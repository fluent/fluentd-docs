    $ git commit -s

# Deploy

We deploy fluentd-docs by Circle-CI automatically.

    $ bundle exec rake last_updated
    $ git add config/last_updated.json

# Contributing docs for v1

v1 docs are under docs/v1. Currently, most articles are symlinked to the corresponding file in docs/.

- If you are updating an exiting article. Just replace the symlink with an actual article.
- If you are adding a new article, just add it under docs/v1.

Once v1 is released, this process will be updated.

# INCLUDE pragma

You can use the "INCLUDE pragma" to avoid copy-and-pasting the same content or updates on multiple pages.

The syntax is as follows:

    INCLUDE: <filename without extension>

    ... the rest of the document.

Please remember to include a blank line between "INCLUDE..." and the rest of the document.
The docs app will search for \<filename\>.txt in the `docs` directory and insert its contents into the current document.

For example, if you write

    INCLUDE: _buffer_parameters

    ... the rest of the document.

then the docs app will insert the contents of \_buffer\_parameters.txt into the current document.
