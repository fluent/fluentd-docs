# Installing Fluentd using .msi Installer (Windows)

This article explains how to install td-agent, the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/), on Windows.

NOTE: <b>Windows version is in 'alpha' release stage</b>, and needs a lot of testing from the community. Please report if you encounter any problems.

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive parts written in C. However, casual users may have difficulty installing and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is providing **the stable distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found [here](http://www.fluentd.org/faqs).

For Windows, we're using the OS native .msi Installer to distribute td-agent.

## Step1: Install td-agent

Please download the `.msi` file from here, and install the software.

## Step2: Run td-agent from Command Prompt

First, please prepare your config file located at `C:/opt/td-agent/conf/td-agent.conf`. The config below is the simplest example to output any incoming records to td-agent's log file.

    :::xml
    <source>
      @type forward
    </source>
    <match test.**>
      @type stdout
    </match>

After you've installed .msi package, you'll see the program called `Td-agent Command Prompt` installed. Please double click this icon in the Windows menu (below is how it looks like on Windows Server 2012).

In the prompt, please execute the command below to launch td-agent process.

    :::command
    > fluentd -c conf\td-agent.conf

Then, please launch another `Td-agent Command Prompt` and type the command below. This will send a record to td-agent process.

    :::command
    > echo {"message":"hello"} | fluent-cat test.event

It's working properly if td-agent process outputs the message `test.foo: {"k", "v"}`.

## Step3: Register td-agent to Windows service

Next, let's register td-agent to Windows service to permanently run as a server process. Please execute `Td-agent Command Prompt` again, and type the two commands below.

    :::term
    > fluentd --reg-winsvc i
    > fluentd --reg-winsvc-fluentdopt '-c C:/opt/td-agent/conf/td-agent.conf -o C:/opt/td-agent/td-agent.log'

## Step4: Run td-agent as Windows service

Please guide yourself to `Control Panel -> System and Security -> Administrative Tools -> Services`, and you'll see `Fluentd Windows Service` is listed.

Please double click `Fluentd Window Service`, and click `Start` button. Then the process will be executed as Windows Service.

The log file will be located at `C:/opt/td-agent/td-agent.log` as we specified in Step 3.

## Step5: Install Plugins

Open `Td-agent Command Prompt` and use `fluent-gem` command.

    :::term
    > fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-xyz --version=1.2.3
