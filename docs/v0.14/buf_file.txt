# file Buffer Plugin

The `file` buffer plugin provides a persistent buffer implementation. It uses files to store buffer chunks on disk.

## Parameters

* [Common Parameters](plugin-common-parameters)
* [Buffer section configurations](buffer-section)

### path

| type   | required | default   | version |
|:------:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|
| string |        ✔ |           | 0.9.0   |

The path where buffer chunks are stored. The ‘*’ is replaced with random characters. This parameter is require

This parameter must be unique to avoid race condition problem. For example, you can't use fixed buffer_path parameter in fluent-plugin-forest. `${tag}` or similar placeholder is needed. Of course, this parameter must also be unique between fluentd instances.

In addition, `path` should not be an other `path` prefix. For example, the following conf doesn't work well. `/var/log/fluent/foo` resumes `/var/log/fluent/foo.bar`'s buffer files during start phase and it causes `No such file or directory` in `/var/log/fluent/foo.bar` side.

    :::text
    <match pattern1>
      <buffer>
        @type file
        path /var/log/fluent/foo
      </buffer>
    </match>

    <match pattern2>
      <buffer>
        @type file
        path /var/log/fluent/foo.bar
      </buffer>
    </match>

Here is the correct version to avoid prefix problem.

    :::text
    <match pattern1>
      <buffer>
        @type file
        path /var/log/fluent/foo.baz
      </buffer>
    </match>

    <match pattern2>
      <buffer>
        @type file
        path /var/log/fluent/foo.bar
      </buffer>
    </match>

## Example

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      <buffer>
        @type file
        path /var/log/fluent/myapp.*.buffer
      </buffer>
    </match>

## Security

By default, buffer file is located on the disk as a [MessagePack format](http://www.msgpack.org/). If you need an additional encryption for the buffer, please check the <a href="http://www.fluentd.org/enterprise">Enterprise Offering</a>.

## Limitation

Caution, `file` buffer implementation depends on the characteristics of local file system. Don't use `file` buffer on remote file system, e.g. NFS, GlusterFS, HDFS and etc. We observed major data loss by using remote file system.
