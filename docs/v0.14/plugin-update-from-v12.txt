# Updating plugin for v0.14 from v0.12

This guide is for plugin authors to show how to update input/output/filter plugins written for Fluentd v0.12 or earlier.

There are something to be considered (see following "Updating Plugins Overview" section for details):

* Plugins which uses v0.12 API will be supported between Fluentd v0.14 and v1 (will be obsoleted at v2).
* Users can use new features of Fluentd v0.14 only with plugins using v0.14 API.
* Plugins which uses v0.14 API don't work on Fluentd v0.12.x.

Fluentd core team strongly recommend to use v0.14 API to make your plugins stable, consistent and easy to test.

## Updating Plugins Overview

These are steps to update your plugins safely.

1. release a latest version for Fluentd v0.12.x
2. update dependency
3. update code and tests
4. upate CI environments
5. release the newer version for Fluentd v0.14.x and later

### 1. release a latest version

At first, you should make a git branch named as `fluentd-v0.12` (if you are using git for that plugin), and release a latest patch version from that branch without any changes, except for fixing dependency about `Fluentd ~> 0.12.0`.
This makes you possible to fix bugs and release newer versions for Fluentd v0.12 users without breaking anything.

* make a branch for Fluentd v0.12 versions
* fix dependency about `Fluentd` to `~> 0.12.0` (or later: `~> 0.12.26`)
* bump your gem's version up to next patch version (for example: `0.4.1` -> `0.4.2`)
* release it to rubygems.org

### 2. update dependency

Following updates are on master branch.
You should update dependency in gemspec at first to depend on Fluentd v0.14.

* fix dependency about `Fluentd` to `>= 0.14.0`
* execute `bundle install`

Is it correct to use `>= 0.14.0` instead of `~> 0.14.0`? Yes. Fluentd v1 will be compatible with v0.14.0 (especially for plugin APIs), so you should use `>= 0.14.0`.
Let's think about v2 few years later.

### 3. update code and tests

There are many difference between plugin types about updating code and tests. See "Updating Plugin Code" section below for each types of plugins.

* update code and tests
* confirm to run `bundle exec rake test`

### 4. update CI environments

If you have CI configurations like `.travis.yml` and `appvayor.yml`, these should be updated to support Fluentd v0.14.
Fluentd v0.14 supports Ruby 2.1 or later. CI environments should not include Ruby 2.0 or earlier. It's good idea to add latest Ruby (2.3 at Jun 2016).

* remove Ruby 2.0 or ealier from CI environments
* add Ruby 2.3 (or other latest version) to CI environments

### 5. release new version

This is last step. The new version should be major or minor version up, not patch version up.
If the current major version of your gem is equal or larger than 1, you should bump major version up (e.g., from 1 to 2). If the current major version is 0, you should bump minor version up (e.g., from `0.4.2` to `0.5.0`).
Then, you can publish a new release which is available with Fluentd v0.14.

* bump the version up
* release it to rubygems.org

## Updating Plugin Code

For all types of plugins, take care about these things:

* require files which contains definitions of classes/modules referred in your plugin code
* call ``super`` in ``#initialize``, ``#configure``, ``#start`` and ``#shutdown``
* use ``router.emit`` to emit events into Fluentd instead of ``Engine.emit``

About updating tests, see "Test code" section for all plugin types.

### Input plugins

For input plugins, points to be fixed are:

* require "fluent/plugin/input" instead of "fluent/input"
* fix superclass from ``Fluent::Input`` to ``Fluent::Plugin::Input``
* use ``compat_parameters`` plugin helper to keep compatibility of configurations to v0.12 style
* use ``Fluent::Engine.now`` or ``Fluent::EventTime.now`` to create current time object instead of ``Time.now.to_i``
* update test code

Plugins will work well only with changes above.

Moreover, most input plugins create threads, timers, network serevers and/or parsers. It's better to use plugin helpers to simplify code and to make tests stable.
For more details, see LINK:[Plugin Helper Overview](/articles/plugin-helper-overview).

### Filter plugins

For filter plugins, points to be fixed are:

* require "fluent/plugin/filter" instead of "fluent/filter"
* fix superclass from ``Fluent::Filter`` to ``Fluent::Plugin::Filter``
* use ``compat_parameters`` plugin helper to keep compatibility of configurations to v0.12 style
* update test code

Plugins will work well only with changes above. But if your plugin implements ``#filter_stream``, remove it if possible. Overriding ``#filter_stream`` make it impossible to optimize filters' performance.

Moreover, many filter plugins uses parsers or formatters. It's better to use plugin helpers for them to simplify code and make it easy to understand the way to configure the plugin.

### Non-buffered output plugins

For output plugins (subclass of ``Fluent::Output``), points to be fixed are:

* require "fluent/plugin/output" instead of "fluent/output"
* fix superclass from ``Fluent::Output`` to ``Fluent::Plugin::Output``
* use ``compat_parameters`` plugin helper to keep compatibility of configurations to v0.12 style
* remove ``#emit`` method and implement ``#process(tag, es)`` method
* update test code

If your output plugin emits events into Fluentd, follow these points too:

* use ``event_emitter`` plugin helper to introduce router
* use ``Fluent::Engine.now`` or ``Fluent::EventTime.now`` to create current time object instead of ``Time.now.to_i``

It's recommended to use plugin helpers if your plugin creates any of thread, timer socket, child process and/or parsers/formatters. It's better to use plugin helpers to simplify code and to make tests stable.
For more details, see LINK:[Plugin Helper Overview](/articles/plugin-helper-overview).

### Buffered output plugins

For buffered output plugins (subclass of ``Fluent::BufferedOutput``), points to be fixed are:

* require "fluent/plugin/output" instead of "fluent/output"
* fix superclass from ``Fluent::BufferedOutput`` to ``Fluent::Plugin::Output``
* use ``compat_parameters`` plugin helper to keep compatibility of configurations to v0.12 style
* implement ``#compat_parameters_default_chunk_key`` to return empty string to show chunk key is not specified
* fix ``config_set_default`` and its parameter names to override parameters in ``<buffer>`` section
* remove ``#format_stream`` method if it is implemented in your plugin (it is not supported)
* update test code

It's recommended to use plugin helpers if your plugin creates any of thread, timer socket, child process and/or parsers/formatters. It's better to use plugin helpers to simplify code and to make tests stable.
For more details, see LINK:[Plugin Helper Overview](/articles/plugin-helper-overview).

### ObjectBuffered output plugins

For object buffered output plugins (subclass of ``Fluent::ObjectBufferedOutput``), points to be fixed are:

* require "fluent/plugin/output" instead of "fluent/output"
* fix superclass from ``Fluent::ObjectBufferedOutput`` to ``Fluent::Plugin::Output``
* use ``compat_parameters`` plugin helper to keep compatibility of configurations to v0.12 style
* implement ``#compat_parameters_default_chunk_key`` to return ``"tag"`` to show chunk key is tag (or something else if your plugin overwrites ``#emit`` to change ``key``)
* fix ``config_set_default`` and its parameter names to override parameters in ``<buffer>`` section
* fix ``#write`` method code not to use ``chunk.key``, to use ``chunk.metadata.tag`` and ``#extract_placeholders``
* update test code

It's recommended to use plugin helpers if your plugin creates any of thread, timer socket, child process and/or parsers/formatters. It's better to use plugin helpers to simplify code and to make tests stable.
For more details, see LINK:[Plugin Helper Overview](/articles/plugin-helper-overview).

### TimeSliced output plugins

For time sliced output plugins (subclass of ``Fluent::TimeSlicedOutput``), points to be fixed are:

* require "fluent/plugin/output" instead of "fluent/output"
* fix superclass from ``Fluent::TimeSlicedOutput`` to ``Fluent::Plugin::Output``
* use ``compat_parameters`` plugin helper to keep compatibility of configurations to v0.12 style
* implement ``#compat_parameters_default_chunk_key`` to return ``"time"`` to show chunk key is time
* set default value of ``timekey`` in ``<buffer>`` section if your plugin specifies default ``time_slice_format``
* fix ``config_set_default`` and its parameter names to override parameters in ``<buffer>`` section
* fix ``#write`` method code not to use ``chunk.key``, to use ``chunk.metadata.timekey`` and ``#extract_placeholders``
* update test code

It's recommended to use plugin helpers if your plugin creates any of thread, timer socket, child process and/or parsers/formatters. It's better to use plugin helpers to simplify code and to make tests stable.

### Multi output plugins

For multi output plugins (subclass of ``Fluent::MultiOutput``), there are many points to be considered.

If the plugin uses ``<store>`` sections and instantiates plugins per each store section, use ``Fluent::Plugin::MultiOutput``. See code to know how to use it: ``lib/fluent/plugin/multi_output.rb`` or some built-in plugins like ``out_copy``, ``out_roundrobin``.

Otherwise, your plugin does something curious for Fluentd. Read code of ``lib/fluent/plugin/output.rb`` and ``lib/fluent/plugin/bare_output.rb``, and consider which is better for your plugin. But it is strongly unrecommended to use ``Fluent::Plugin::BareOutput`` for most use cases.
