# grep Filter Plugin

The `filter_grep` filter plugin "greps" events by the values of specified fields.

## Example Configurations

`filter_grep` is included in Fluentd's core. No installation required.

    :::text
    <filter foo.bar>
      @type grep
      <regexp>
        key message
        pattern cool
      </regexp>
      <regexp>
        key hostname
        pattern ^web\d+\.example\.com$
      </regexp>
      <exclude>
        key message
        pattern uncool
      </exclude>
    </filter>

The above example matches any event that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The value of the "message" field contains "cool"
2. The value of the "hostname" field matches `web<INTEGER>.example.com`.
3. The value of the "message" field does NOT contain "uncool".

Hence, the following events are kept:

    :::text
    {"message":"It's cool outside today", "hostname":"web001.example.com"}
    {"message":"That's not cool", "hostname":"web1337.example.com"}

whereas the following examples are filtered out:

    :::text
    {"message":"I am cool but you are uncool", "hostname":"db001.example.com"}
    {"hostname":"web001.example.com"}
    {"message":"It's cool outside today"}

## Parameters

[Common Parameters](plugin-common-parameters)

### &lt;regexp&gt; directive (optional)
Specify filtering rule. This directive contains two parameters.

- key

The field name to which the regular expression is applied.

This parameter supports nested field access via [record_accessor syntax](api-plugin-helper-record_accessor#syntax).

- pattern

The regular expression.

For example, the following filters out events unless the field "price" is a positive integer.

    :::text
    <regexp>
      key price
      pattern [1-9]\d*
    </regexp>

The grep filter filters out UNLESS all `<regexp>`s are matched. Hence, if you have

    :::text
    <regexp>
      key price
      pattern [1-9]\d*
    </regexp>
    <regexp>
      key item_name
      pattern ^book_
    </regexp>

unless the event's "item_name" field starts with "book_" and the "price" field is an integer, it is filtered out.

For OR condition, you can use `|` operator of regular expressions. For example, if you have

    :::text
    <regexp>
      key item_name
      pattern (^book_|^article)
    </regexp>

unless the event's "item_name" field starts with "book_" or "article_", it is filtered out.

### regexpN (optional)
This is deprecated parameter. Use `<regexp>` instead.

The "N" at the end should be replaced with an integer between 1 and 20 (ex: "regexp1"). regexpN takes two whitespace-delimited arguments.

Here is `regexpN` version of `<regexp>` example:

    :::text
    regexp1 price [1-9]\d*
    regexp2 item_name ^book_

### &lt;exclude&gt; directive (optional)
Specify filtering rule to reject events. This directive contains two parameters.

- key

The field name to which the regular expression is applied.

This parameter supports nested field access via [record_accessor syntax](api-plugin-helper-record_accessor#syntax).

- pattern

The regular expression.

For example, the following filters out events whose "status_code" field is 5xx.

    :::text
    <exclude>
      key status_code
      pattern ^5\d\d$
    </exclude>

The grep filter filters out if any `<exclude>` is matched. Hence, if you have

    :::text
    <exclude>
      key status_code
      pattern ^5\d\d$
    </exclude>
    <exclude>
      key url
      pattern \.css$
    </exclude>

Then, any event whose "status_code" is 5xx OR "url" ends with ".css" is filtered out.

### excludeN (optional)
This is deprecated parameter. Use `<exclude>` instead.

The "N" at the end should be replaced with an integer between 1 and 20 (ex: "exclude1"). excludeN takes two whitespace-delimited arguments.

Here is `excludeN` version of `<exclude>` example:

    :::text
    exclude1 status_code ^5\d\d$
    exclude2 url \.css$

NOTE: If <code>&lt;regexp&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;exclude&gt;</code> are used together, both are applied.
