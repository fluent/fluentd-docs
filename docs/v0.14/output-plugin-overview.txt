# Output Plugin Overview

Fluentd has 6 types of plugins: [Input](input-plugin-overview), [Parser](parser-plugin-overview), [Filter](filter-plugin-overview), [Output](output-plugin-overview), [Formatter](formatter-plugin-overview), [Storage](storage-plugin-overview) and [Buffer](buffer-plugin-overview). This article gives an overview of Output Plugin.

## Overview

Fluentd v0.14 output plugins have 3 modes about buffering and flushing.

* *Non-Buffered* mode doesn't buffer data and write out results immediately.
* *Synchronous Buffered* mode has "staged" buffer chunks (a chunk is a collection of events) and a queue of chunks, and its behavior can be controlled by `<buffer>` section (See the diagram below).
* *Asynchronous Buffered* mode also has "stage" and "queue", but output plugin will not commit writing chunks in methods synchronously, but commit later.

![Fluentd v0.14 Plugin API Overview](//docs.fluentd.org/images/fluentd-v0.14-plugin-api-overview.png)

Output plugins can support all modes, but may support just one of these modes. Fluentd choose appropriate mode automatically if there are no `<buffer>` sections in configuration. If users specify `<buffer>` section for output plugins which doesn't support buffering, Fluentd will stop with configuration errors.

Output plugins in v0.14 can control keys of buffer chunking by configurations, dynamically. Users can configure buffer chunk keys as time (any unit specified by user), tag and any key name of records. Output plugin will split events into chunks: events in a chunk have same values for chunk keys.
The output plugin's buffer behavior (if any) is defined by a separate [Buffer plugin](buffer-plugin-overview). Different buffer plugins can be chosen for each output plugin.

## Difference between v0.14 and v0.12

Fluentd v0.12 uses only `<match>` section for both of configuration parameters of output plugin and buffer plugin.
Fluentd v0.14 uses `<buffer>` subsection to write parameters for buffering, flushing and retrying. `<match>` sections are used only for output plugin itself.

Example of v0.14 output plugin configuration:

    :::text
    <match myservice_name>
      @type file
      path /my/data/access.${tag}.%Y-%m-%d.%H%M.log
      <buffer tag,time>
        @type file
        path /my/buffer/myservice
        timekey     60m
        timekey_wait 1m
      </buffer>
    </source>

For Fluentd v0.12, configuration parameters for buffer plugins were written in same section:

    :::text
    <match myservice_name>
      @type file
      path /my/data/access.myservice_name.*.log
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /my/buffer/myservice/access.myservice_name.*.log
      time_slice_format %Y-%m-%d.%H%M
      time_slice_wait   1m
    </source>


## Buffering/Retrying Parameters

TODO: list parameters available in `<buffer>` section

### Control Flushing

TODO: This description is copied from buffer overview of v0.12, and must be updated with v0.14 features.

If queue is empty when chunks are pushed into queue, queued chunk will be flushed immediately.

When the top chunk exceeds the specified size or time limit (`buffer_chunk_limit` and `flush_interval`, respectively), a new empty chunk is pushed to the top of the queue. The bottom chunk is written out immediately when new chunk is pushed.

If the bottom chunk write out fails, it will remain in the queue and Fluentd will retry after waiting several seconds (`retry_wait`). If the retry limit has not been disabled (`disable_retry_limit` is false) and the retry count exceeds the specified limit (`retry_limit`), the chunk is trashed. The retry wait time doubles each time (1.0sec, 2.0sec, 4.0sec, ...) until `max_retry_wait` is reached. If the queue length exceeds the specified limit (`buffer_queue_limit`), new events are rejected.

NOTE: writing out the bottom chunk is considered to be a failure if "BufferedOutput#write" method throws an exception.

### Control Retrying


For other configuration parameters available in `<buffer>` sections, see [Buffer plugin overview](buffer-plugin-overview) and each plugins.

## Secondary Output

In buffered mode, the user can specify `<secondary>` with any output plugin in `<match>` configuration.
If plugins continue to fail writing buffer chunks and exceeds the timeout threshold for retries, then output plugins will delegate to write the buffer chunk to secondary plugin.

`<secondary>` is useful for backup when destination servers are unavailable, e.g. forward, mongo and other plugins. We strongly recommend `out_file` plugin for `<secondary>`.

TODO: add examples for secondary output
