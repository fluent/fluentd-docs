# relabel Output Plugin

The `relabel` output plugin re-labels events.

## Example Configuration

`out_relabel` is included in Fluentd's core. No additional installation process is required.

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      @type relabel
      @label @foo
    </match>

    <label @foo>
      <match patter>
        ...
      </match>
    </label>

The above example puts a label `@foo` to matched events, and the `label`
directive can take care of these events.

FYI: All of input and output plugins also have `@label` parameter provided by
Fluentd core. The `relabel` plugin is a plugin which actually does nothing,
but supports only `@label` parameter.

## Parameters

### @type (required)

The value must be `relabel`.

### @label

The label.

INCLUDE: _log_level_params
