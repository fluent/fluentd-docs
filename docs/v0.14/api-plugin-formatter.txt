# Writing Formatter Plugins

Fluentd supports [pluggable, customizable formats for output plugins](formatter-plugin-overview). The plugin files whose names start with "formatter_" are registered as Formatter Plugins. See LINK:[Plugin Base Class API](api-plugin-base) to show details of common API for all plugin types.

Here is an example of a custom formatter that outputs events as CSVs. It takes a required parameter called "csv_fields" and outputs the fields. It assumes that the values of the fields are already valid CSV fields.

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/plugin/formatter'

    module Fluent::Plugin
      class MyCSVFormatter < Formatter
        # Register MyCSVFormatter as "my_csv".
        Fluent::Plugin.register_formatter("my_csv", self)

        config_param :csv_fields, :array, value_type: :string

        # This method does further processing. Configuration parameters can be
        # accessed either via "conf" hash or member variables.
        def configure(conf)
          super
        end

        # This is the method that formats the data output.
        def format(tag, time, record)
          values = []

          # Look up each required field and collect them from the record
          @csv_fields.each do |field|
            v = record[field]
            unless v
              log.error "#{field} is missing."
            end
            values << v.to_s
          end

          # Output by joining the fields with a comma
          values.join(",")
        end
      end
    end

Then, save this code in `formatter_my_csv.rb` in a loadable plugin path. Then, if out_file is configured as

    :::text
    # Other lines...
    <match test>
      @type file
      path /path/to/output/file
      <format>
        @type my_csv
        csv_fields k1,k2
      </format>
    </match>

and if the record `{"k1": 100, "k2": 200}` is matched, the output file should look like `100,200`

## How To Use Formatters From Plugins

Formatter plugins are designed to be used from other plugins, like Input, Filter and Output.
There is a Formatter plugin helper for that purpose (v0.14.1 or later):

    :::ruby
    # in class definition
    helpers :formatter

    # in #configure
    @formatter = formatter_create(type: 'json')

    # in #filter, #format or ...
    es.each do |time, record|
      row = @formatter.format(@tag, time, record)
      # ...
    end

See LINK:[Formatter Plugin Helper API](api-plugin-helper-formatter) for details.

## Methods

Formatter plugins have a method to format input record (Hash) into a String object.

#### #format(tag, time, record)

``Formatter#format`` gets an event represented with tag (String), time (Fluent::EventTime or Integer) and record (Hash with String keys), and should return a String object, the result of formatting.

Formatter plugins must implement this method.

## Writing Tests

Fluentd formatter plugin has just one or some points to be tested. Others (parsing configurations, controlling buffers, retries, flushes and many others) are controlled by Fluentd core.

Fluentd also provides test driver for plugins. You can write tests of your own plugins very easily:

    ::ruby
    # test/plugin/test_formatter_your_own.rb

    require 'test/unit'
    require 'fluent/test/driver/formatter'
    
    # your own plugin
    require 'fluent/plugin/formatter_your_own'
    
    class FormatterYourOwnTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      def setup
        # common setup
      end
      
      COPNFIG = %[
        fields a,b,c
      ]
      
      def create_driver(conf = CONF)
        Fluent::Test::Driver::Formatter.new(Fluent::Plugin::YourOwnFormatter).configure(conf)
      end
      
      sub_test_case 'configured with invalid configurations' do
        test 'empty' do
          assert_raise(Fluent::ConfigError) do
            create_driver('')
          end
        end
        # ...
      end
      
      sub_test_case 'plugin will format record' do
        test 'record has a field' do
          d = create_driver(CONFIG)
          tag = "test"
          time = FLuent::EventTime.now
          record = { "message" => "This is message" }
          formatted = d.instance.format(tag, time, record)
          expected = "..."
          assert_equal(expected, formatted)
        end
      end
    end

### Overview of Tests

Testing for formatter plugins are mainly for:

* Configuration/Validation checks for invalid configurations (about ``#configure``)
* Checks for formatted by formatter plugins

Plugin test driver provides logger and feature to override system configurations, and configuration parser and others to make it easy to test configuration errors or others.

Lifecycle of plugins and test drivers is:

1. Instantiate plugin driver (and it instantiates plugin)
2. Configure plugin
3. Run test code
4. Assert results of tests by data provided from driver

Test drivers instantiate the plugin. See LINK:[Testing API for plugins](api-plugin-test) for details.

For configuration tests, repeat 1-2. For full feature tests, repeat 1-4. Test drivers and helper methods will support it.
