# Filter Plugin Overview

Fluentd has 7 types of plugins: [Input](input-plugin-overview), [Parser](parser-plugin-overview), [Filter](filter-plugin-overview), [Output](output-plugin-overview), [Formatter](formatter-plugin-overview), [Storage](storage-plugin-overview) and [Buffer](buffer-plugin-overview). This article gives an overview of Filter Plugin.

## Overview

Filter plugins enables Fluentd to modify event streams. Example use cases are:

1. Filtering out events by grepping the value of one or more fields.
2. Enriching events by adding new fields.
3. Deleting or masking certain fields for privacy and compliance.

## How to Use

It is used with the `<filter>` directive as follows:

    :::term
    <filter foo.bar>
      @type grep
      regexp1 message cool
    </filter>

The above directive matches events with the tag "foo.bar", and if the "message" field's value contains "cool", the events go through the rest of the configuration.

Like the `<match>` directive for output plugins, `<filter>` matches against a tag. Once the event is processed by the filter, the event proceeds through the configuration top-down. Hence, if there are multiple filters for the same tag, they are applied in descending order. Hence, in the following example,

    :::term
    <filter foo.bar>
      @type grep
      regexp1 message cool
    </filter>

    <filter foo.bar>
      @type record_transformer
      <record>
        hostname "#{Socket.gethostname}"
      </record>
    </filter>

Only the events whose "message" field contain "cool" get the new field "hostname" with the machine's hostname as its value.

# Custom Plugins

Users can create their own custom plugins with a bit of Ruby. See [this section](plugin-development#filter-plugins) for more information.
