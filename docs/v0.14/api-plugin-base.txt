# Plugin Base API

All plugin types are subclass of ``Fluent::Plugin::Base`` in Fluentd v0.14 or later. Base class has some features and methods which provides basic mechanism as plugins.
This page shows these methods provided by ``Fluent::Plugin::Base``, and other methods provided commonly in some type of plugins.

The methods listed below are considered as public methods, and will be maintained not to break compatibility. Other methods may be changed without compatibility consideration.

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/plugin/input' # this might be input, filter, output, parser, formatter, storage or buffer

    module Fluent::Plugin
      class MyExampleInput < Input
        # Plugins should be registered by calling ``Fluent::Plugin.register_TYPE`` method with name and ``self``.
        # The first argument String is to identify that plugin in configuration files.
        # The second argument is class of plugin itself, ``self`` in most cases.
        Fluent::Plugin.register_output('my_example', self)
  
        desc "The port number"
        # config_param defines a parameter. You can refer a parameter via @port instance variable.
        # Without :default, a parameter is required.
        config_param :port, :integer

        config_section :user, param_name: :users, multi: true, required: false do
          desc "Username for authentication"
          config_param :username, :string
          desc "Password for authentication"
          config_param :password, :string, secret: true
        end
  
        def configure(conf)
          super
  
          # If the configuration is invalid, raise Fluent::ConfigError.
          if @port <= 1024
            raise Fluent::ConfigError, "port number is too small: #{@port}"
          end

          @users.each do |user|
            if user.password.length < 5
              raise Fluent::ConfigError, "password is too short for user '#{user.username}'"
            end
          end
        end
  
        def start
          super
          # ...
        end
  
        def shutdown
          # ...
          super
        end
      end
    end

## Class methods

Base class has some methods to create configurable parameters for plugins, or to provide system configurations to plugins.

#### .config_param(name, type = nil, **options, &block)

Define a parameter.

* `name`: parameter name as symbol
* `type`: parameter type
* `options`: options for parameter
* `block`: if block is given, convert value via given block

About types and options, see LINK:[Types of Configuration Parameters](api-config-types).

    :::ruby
    config_param :name, :string, default: "John Doe", alias: :full_name

    config_param :pattern, do |value|
      Regexp.compile(value)
    end

    config_param :delimiter, default: "\t" do |value|
      case value
      when /SPACE/i then " "
      when /COMMA/i then ","
      else "\t"
      end
    end

#### .config_set_default(name, default_value)

Set default value to `name`. If the default value has already been existed, raise `ArgumentError`.

* `name`: The name of parameter
* `default_value`: Default value for the parameter

    :::ruby
    # lib/fluent/plugin/buffer.rb
    config_param :chunk_limit_size, :size, default: DEFAULT_CHUNK_LIMIT_SIZE

    # lib/fluent/plugin/buf_file.rb
    config_set_default :chunk_limit_size, DEFAULT_CHUNK_LIMIT_SIZE

#### .config_set_desc(name, description)

TODO: write this section later

#### .desc(description)

#### .config_section(name, **options, &block)

#### .configured_in(section_name)

#### .system_config

#### .system_config_override(options = {})

## Instance methods

#### #initialize

This method is used to initialize internal states (instance variables). Call ``super`` if the plugin overrides this method.

    :::ruby
    def initialize
      super
      @internal_counter = 0
      @in_memory_cache = nil
    end

#### #configure(conf)

``conf`` is an instance of ``Fluent::Config::Element``. Call ``super`` if the plugin overrides this method. Fluentd's Configurable module (included in Base class) will traverse ``conf`` object, and set values from configurations or default values into instance variables in ``super``.
So instance variables or accessor methods are available after ``super`` in ``#configure`` method.

The code to configure the plugin by itself should be after ``super``.

    :::ruby
    def configure(conf)
      super

      # cache_default_value is created/configured by config_param
      @in_memory_cache = Hash.new(@cache_default_value)
    end

The return value of this method will be ignored.

#### #log

TODO: write this section later with list of logger methods

#### #has_router?

This method returns true or false, which indicates ``#router`` method is provided or not. Default is false.
If the plugin uses ``event_emitter`` plugin helper, this method will return true.

NOTE: Input plugin enables ``event_emitter`` plugin helper in default.

#### #start

This method is called when Fluentd starts, after all configuration steps. Call ``super`` if the plugin overrides this method.

Creating/Opening timers, threads, listening sockets, file handles and others should be done in this method after ``super``. Many of these may be provided as plugin helpers. See API details of each plugin helpers.

    :::ruby
    def start
      super

      timer_execute(:my_example_timer, 30) do
        # any code which will be executed every 30 seconds
        # during Fluentd is running
      end
    end

#### #stop

This method is called at first in shutdown sequence of Fluentd. Call ``super`` if the plugin overrides this method.

This method should be used to enable flag to stop loops, network servers or something else, gracefully. This method SHOULD NOT do anything which may raise errors.

    :::ruby
    def start # example
      super
      @my_thread_running = true
      @my_thread = thread_create(:example_code) do
        if @my_thread_running
          log.debug "loop is running"
        end
      end
    end
    def stop
      @my_thread_running = false

      super
    end

``super`` should be called at last in methods of shutdown sequence: ``stop``, ``before_shutdown``, ``shutdown``, ``after_shutdown``, ``close`` and ``terminate``.

#### #before_shutdown

This method is called after ``#stop`` and before ``#shutdown``. Call ``super`` if the plugin overrides this method.
There are no need to implement this method by 3rd party plugins in most cases. This method is used to control flushing buffered events in shutdown sequence.

#### #shutdown

This method is called when shutting down. Call ``super`` if the plugin overrides this method.

The plugin should close file handles, network connections, listening servers and other resources. The plugin can emit events in this method, and cannot emit events after this method is called.

    :::ruby
    def shutdown
      @server.close
      records = my_convert_method(@server.rest_data)
      records.each do |record|
        router.emit(@tag, Fluent::Engine.now, record)
      end

      super
    end

#### #after_shutdown

This method is called after ``#shutdown``. Call ``super`` if the plugin overrides this method.
There are no need to implement this method by 3rd party plugins in most cases. This method is used to control emitting events in shutdown sequence.

#### #close

Call ``super`` if the plugin overrides this method.
The plugin can use this method to close resources which is used in plugins and cannot be closed in ``#shutdown``.

#### #terminate

Call ``super`` if the plugin overrides this method.
The plugin can use this method to re-initialize internal states to make it possible to reuse plugin instances in tests or others.

## Methods for Input/Filter/Output

The methods below are available in subclass of Input, Filter and Output. Other types

#### .helpers(*symbols)

The plugin can include features of plugin helpers by calling this method with symbol arguments.

    :::ruby
    module Fluent::Plugin
      class MyPlugin < Input
        Fluent::Plugin.register_input('my_plugin', self)

        # This call enables Timer and Storage plugin helpers
        helpers :timer, :storage

        # ...
      end
    end

It is strongly recommended to call this method at the top of plugin class definition (just after calling ``#register_foo``) to show which plugin helpers this plugin uses explicitly.

#### #plugin_id

This method provides an id string of plugin instance which is unique in Fluentd process. It might be specified by users in configuration files, or might be generated automatically.
The plugin must not expect any fixed formats for return values.

#### #plugin_id_configured?

This method returns true or false to indicate ``#plugin_id`` is configured by users or not.
