# Writing Filter Plugins

This section shows how to write custom filters in addition to [the core filter plugins](filter-plugin-overview). The plugin files whose names start with "filter_" are registered as filter plugins. See LINK:[Plugin Base Class API](/articles/api-plugin-base) to show details of common API for all plugin types.

Here is the implementation of the most basic filter that passes through all events as-is:

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/plugin/filter'

    module Fluent::Plugin
      class PassThruFilter < Filter
        # Register this filter as "passthru"
        Fluent::Plugin.register_filter('passthru', self)

        # config_param works like other plugins

        def configure(conf)
          super
          # do the usual configuration here
        end

        # def start
        #   super
        #   # Override this method if anything needed as startup.
        # end

        # def shutdown
        #   # Override this method to use it to free up resources, etc.
        #   super
        # end

        def filter(tag, time, record)
          # Since our example is a pass-thru filter, it does nothing and just
          # returns the record as-is.
          # If returns nil, that records are ignored.
          record
        end
      end
    end


## Methods

Filter plugins have a method to be implemented.

#### #filter(tag, time, record)

This method implements the filtering logic for individual filters. ``tag`` is a String, ``time`` is a Fluent::EventTime or an Integer and ``record`` is a Hash with String keys.

The return value of this method should be a Hash of modified record, or nil. Fluentd will ignore the event which the filter returns nil.
