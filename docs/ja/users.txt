When I first started at <a href="http://thebackplane.com/">Backplane</a>, I wanted to get us to start logging everything and aggregating it in JSON, and I wanted that system up and running fast. Fluentd got me there in less than a day. I was skeptical of reliability at first, but it takes so little time to setup, there's no reason not to try it.

It hasn't crashed once yet, works exactly as I need it to thanks to the huge plugin library, and likely saved us a ton of time. As an added bonus: the user list for Fluentd was also way more responsive when I ran into initial setup questions than those of any competitors. If you want to start logging your data fast, Fluentd is a great way to go. - Eli Finkelshteyn, Lead Data Scientist
