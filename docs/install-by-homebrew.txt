# Installing Fluentd using Homebrew (MacOS X)

This article explains how to install td-agent, the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasure-data.com/), on MacOS X.

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive parts written in C. However, casual users may have difficulty installing and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasure-data.com/) is providing **the stable distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found [here](faq#what-is-the-difference-with-td-agent-and-fluentd).

For MacOS X, we're using the [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) packaging manager to distribute td-agent.

## Step1: Install Homebrew

If you haven't installed Homebrew on your Mac yet, please install it using the command below.

    :::term
    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
    $ which brew
    /usr/local/bin/brew

## Step2: Install td-agent

Once you have the `brew` command, please use `brew install` to fetch the td-agent formula and install td-agent.

    :::term
    $ brew install "http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com/brew/td-agent.rb"

You can launch `td-agent` in a foreground process.

    :::term
    $ td-agent
    2013-04-19 16:55:03 -0700 [info]: starting fluentd-0.10.33
    2013-04-19 16:55:03 -0700 [info]: reading config file path="/usr/local/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf"

Alternatively, you can manage the `td-agent` daemon process with `launchctl`. This is not necessary, but it's convenient if you want to continuously run td-agent in the background. Let's register `td-agent` as a built-in daemon and launch it using the `launchctl` command.

    :::term
    # Register
    $ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/td-agent/homebrew.mxcl.td-agent.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/.
    
    # Start
    $ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.td-agent.plist
    $ ps aux | grep 'td-agent'
    kzk 66680 0.0 0.0 2432768   616 s002 R+ 4:49PM 0:00.00 grep td-agent
    kzk 66673 0.0 0.1 2476340 20604   ?? S  4:49PM 0:00.10 /usr/local/Cellar/td-agent/1.1.12/bin/ruby /usr/local/Cellar/td-agent/1.1.12/bin/td-agent --log /usr/local/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log
    kzk 66672 0.0 0.1 2454904 14624   ?? S  4:49PM 0:00.12 /usr/local/Cellar/td-agent/1.1.12/bin/ruby /usr/local/Cellar/td-agent/1.1.12/bin/td-agent --log /usr/local/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log
    
    # Stop
    $ launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.td-agent.plist


Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at `/usr/local/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`. Your plugin directory is at `/usr/local/etc/td-agent/plugin`.

## Step3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/usr/local/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and route them to stdout (`/usr/local/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`). You can post sample log records using the curl command.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
    $ tail -n 1 /usr/local/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log
    2013-04-19 16:51:47 -0700 debug.test: {"json":"message"}
