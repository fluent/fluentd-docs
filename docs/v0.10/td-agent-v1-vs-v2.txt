# td-agent v1 vs. td-agent v2

## Supported Platforms

[Treasure Data, Inc.](http://www.treasuredata.com) maintains stable packages for Fluentd and canonical plugins as Treasure Agent (the package is called `td-agent`). td-agent has v1 and v2, and v2 is NOT backward-compatible with v1. That said, v2 supports more platforms and incorporates all future improvements.

## Features

Major feature updates to td-agent v2 are as follows.

- Ruby 2.1
- Fluentd v0.12
- Updated for the core libraries, msgpack, Cool.io, etc.
- Changed the installation directory from `/usr/{lib,lib64}/fluent` to `/opt/td-agent`
- `td-agent-gem` utility command was added
  - To install a third-party plugin, use /usr/sbin/td-agent-gem command
  - This utility was introduced to resolve the issues around rvm.
- Uses [Fluentd v1 configuration](http://docs.fluentd.org/articles/config-file#v1-format) by default

## Upgrading from v1 to v2

Because v1 and v2 package structure are not compatible, update commands provided by package managers (ex: `yum update`) cannot be used to migrate from v1 to v2. To upgrade from v1 to v2:

1. Uninstall v1.
2. Install v2.
3. Install the plugins for v2.

If your current td-agent v1 deployment uses third-party plugins, make sure that they are compatible with v2 (Most of them should work out of the box).

## td-agent v1 becomes the "old" stable version

Since there is a large existing user base for td-agent v1, it will be maintained as the "old" stable version. td-agent v1 will use Fluentd v0.10.x.

**If using Fluentd/td-agent for the first time/a new project, td-agent v2 is strongly recommended.**
