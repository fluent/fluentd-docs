# Installing Fluentd using .dmg Installer (MacOS X)

This article explains how to install td-agent, the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/), on MacOS X.

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive parts written in C. However, casual users may have difficulty installing and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is providing **the stable distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found [here](http://www.fluentd.org/faqs).

For MacOS X, we're using the OS native .dmg Installer to distribute td-agent.

## Step1: Install td-agent

Please download the `.dmg` file from here, and install the software.

## Step2: Launch td-agent

You can launch `td-agent` with `launchctl` command. Please make sure the daemon started correctly from the log (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`).

    :::term
    $ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/td-agent.plist
    $ less /var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log
    2013-04-19 16:55:03 -0700 [info]: starting fluentd-0.10.33
    2013-04-19 16:55:03 -0700 [info]: reading config file path="/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf"

**Your configuration file** is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`. Your plugin directory is at `/etc/td-agent/plugin`. In case you want to stop the agent, please execute the command below.

    :::term
    $ sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/td-agent.plist

## Step3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and route them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`). You can post sample log records using the curl command.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
    $ tail -n 1 /var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log
    2013-04-19 16:51:47 -0700 debug.test: {"json":"message"}

## Uninstall td-agent

td-agent for Mac doesn't provide uninstallation app unlike rpm / deb. If you want to uninstall td-agent from your Mac, remove these files / directories.

- /Library/LaunchDaemons/td-agent.plist
- /etc/td-agent
- /opt/td-agent
- /var/log/td-agent
