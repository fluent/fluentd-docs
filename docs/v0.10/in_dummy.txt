# dummy Input Plugin (v0.10.58 and higher)

The `in_dummy` input plugin generates dummy events. It is useful for testing, debugging, benchmarking and getting started with Fluentd.

## Example Configuration

`in_dummy` is included in Fluentd's core. No additional installation process is required.

    :::text
    <source>
      type dummy
      dummy {"hello":"world"}
    </source>

NOTE: Please see the <a href="config-file">Config File</a> article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

## Parameters

#### @type (required)
The value must be `dummy`.

#### tag (required)
The value is the tag assigned to the generated events.

#### dummy (optional)
The dummy data to be generated. It should be either an array of JSON hashes or a single JSON hash. If it is an array of JSON hashes, the hashes in the array are cycled through in order. By default, the value is `[{"message":"dummy"}]` (i.e., it continues to generate events with the record {"message":"dummy"}).

#### auto_increment_key (optional, string type)
If specified, each generated event has an auto-incremented key field. For example, with `auto_increment_key foo_key`, the first couple of events look like

    :::term
    2014-12-14 23:23:38 +0000 test: {"message":"dummy","foo_key":0}
    2014-12-14 23:23:38 +0000 test: {"message":"dummy","foo_key":1}
    2014-12-14 23:23:38 +0000 test: {"message":"dummy","foo_key":2}

#### rate (optional, integer type)
It configures how many events to generate per second. The default value is 1.
