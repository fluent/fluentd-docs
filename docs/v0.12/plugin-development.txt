# Writing plugins

## Installing custom plugins

To install a plugin, please put the ruby script in the ``/etc/fluent/plugin`` directory.

Alternatively, you can create a Ruby Gem package that includes a ``lib/fluent/plugin/<TYPE>_<NAME>.rb`` file. The *TYPE* is:

- ``in`` for input plugins
- ``out`` for output plugins
- ``filter`` for filter plugins
- ``buf`` for buffer plugins
- ``parser`` for parser plugins
- ``formatter`` for formatter plugins

For example, an email Output plugin would have the path: ``lib/fluent/plugin/out_mail.rb``. The packaged gem can be distributed and installed using RubyGems. For further information, please see the [list of Fluentd plugins](http://www.fluentd.org/plugins) for third-party plugins.

## Overview

The following slides can help the user understand how Fluentd works before they dive into writing their own plugins.

### Fluentd version and Plugin API

Fluentd now has two active versions, v0.12 and v0.14.
v0.12 is stable and many users use this version on production.
v0.14 is edge version and this version has brand-new Plugin API.

Plugin for v0.12 works with v0.12 and v0.14, but
new v0.14 Plugin API doesn't work with v0.12.
So if you want to release new plugin, using v0.12 API is better for now.

This document based on v0.12 Plugin API.

### Send a patch or fork?

If you have a problem with existing plugins or new feature idea, sending a patch is better.
If the plugin author is non-active, try to become new plugin maintainer first.
Forking a plugin and release alternative plugin, e.g. fluent-plugin-xxx-alt, is final approach.

## Plugin versioning policy

If you don't have a your policy, following semantic versioning is better.

[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 - Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)

The important thing is if your plugin breaks the backward compatibiliy, update major version to avoid user troubles.
For example, new v0.14 API based plugin doesn't work with fluentd v0.12. So if you release your existing plugin with new v0.14 API,
please update major version, `0.5.0` -> `1.0.0`, `1.2.0` -> `2.0.0`.

## Writing Input Plugins

Extend the **Fluent::Input** class and implement the following methods. In `initialize`, `configure` and `start`, `super` should be called to call Input plugin default behaviour.

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/input'

    module Fluent
      class SomeInput < Input
        # First, register the plugin. NAME is the name of this plugin
        # and identifies the plugin in the configuration file.
        Fluent::Plugin.register_input('NAME', self)
  
        # config_param defines a parameter. You can refer a parameter via @port instance variable
        # :default means this parameter is optional
        config_param :port, :integer, :default => 8888
  
        # This method is called before starting.
        # 'conf' is a Hash that includes configuration parameters.
        # If the configuration is invalid, raise Fluent::ConfigError.
        def configure(conf)
          super
  
          # You can also refer to raw parameter via conf[name].
          @port = conf['port']
          ...
        end
  
        # This method is called when starting.
        # Open sockets or files and create a thread here.
        def start
          super
          ...
        end
  
        # This method is called when shutting down.
        # Shutdown the thread and close sockets or files here.
        def shutdown
          super
          ...
        end
      end
    end

To submit events, use the ``router.emit(tag, time, record)`` method, where ``tag`` is the String, ``time`` is the UNIX time integer and ``record`` is a Hash object.

    :::ruby
    tag = "myapp.access"
    time = Engine.now
    record = {"message"=>"body"}
    router.emit(tag, time, record)

To submit multiple events in one call, use the ``router.emit_stream(tag, es)`` and ``MultiEventStream`` combo instead.

    :::ruby
    es = MultiEventStream.new
    records.each { |record|
      es.add(time, record)
    }
    router.emit_stream(tag, es)

### Record format

Fluentd plugins assume the record is a JSON so the key should be the String, not Symbol.
If you emit a symbol keyed record, it may cause a problem.

    :::ruby
    router.emit(tag, time, {'foo' => 'bar'})  # OK!
    router.emit(tag, time, {:foo => 'bar'})   # NG!

## Writing Buffered Output Plugins

Extend the **Fluent::BufferedOutput** class and implement the following methods. In `initialize`, `configure` and `start`, `super` should be called to call BufferedOutput plugin default behaviour.

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/output'

    module Fluent
      class SomeOutput < BufferedOutput
        # First, register the plugin. NAME is the name of this plugin
        # and identifies the plugin in the configuration file.
        Fluent::Plugin.register_output('NAME', self)
  
        # config_param defines a parameter. You can refer a parameter via @path instance variable
        # Without :default, a parameter is required.
        config_param :path, :string
  
        # This method is called before starting.
        # 'conf' is a Hash that includes configuration parameters.
        # If the configuration is invalid, raise Fluent::ConfigError.
        def configure(conf)
          super
  
          # You can also refer raw parameter via conf[name].
          @path = conf['path']
          ...
        end
  
        # This method is called when starting.
        # Open sockets or files here.
        def start
          super
          ...
        end
  
        # This method is called when shutting down.
        # Shutdown the thread and close sockets or files here.
        def shutdown
          super
          ...
        end
  
        # This method is called when an event reaches to Fluentd.
        # Convert the event to a raw string.
        def format(tag, time, record)
          [tag, time, record].to_json + "\n"
          ## Alternatively, use msgpack to serialize the object.
          # [tag, time, record].to_msgpack
        end
  
        # This method is called every flush interval. Write the buffer chunk
        # to files or databases here.
        # 'chunk' is a buffer chunk that includes multiple formatted
        # events. You can use 'data = chunk.read' to get all events and
        # 'chunk.open {|io| ... }' to get IO objects.
        #
        # NOTE! This method is called by internal thread, not Fluentd's main thread. So IO wait doesn't affect other plugins.
        def write(chunk)
          data = chunk.read
          print data
        end
  
        ## Optionally, you can use chunk.msgpack_each to deserialize objects.
        #def write(chunk)
        #  chunk.msgpack_each {|(tag,time,record)|
        #  }
        #end
      end
    end


## Writing Time Sliced Output Plugins

Time Sliced Output plugins are extended versions of buffered output plugins. One example of a time sliced output is the ``out_file`` plugin.

Note that Time Sliced Output plugins use file buffer by default. Thus the ``buffer_path`` option is required.

To implement a Time Sliced Output plugin, extend the **Fluent::TimeSlicedOutput** class and implement the following methods.

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/output'

    module Fluent
      class SomeOutput < TimeSlicedOutput
        # configure(conf), start(), shutdown() and format(tag, time, record) are
        # the same as BufferedOutput.
        ...
  
        # You can use 'chunk.key' to get sliced time. The format of 'chunk.key'
        # can be configured by the 'time_format' option. The default format is %Y%m%d.
        def write(chunk)
          day = chunk.key
          ...
        end
      end
    end


## Writing Non-buffered Output Plugins

Extend the **Fluent::Output** class and implement the following methods. **Output** plugin is often used for implementing filter like plugin. In `initialize`, `configure` and `start`, `super` should be called to call non-buffered Output plugin default behaviour.

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/output'

    module Fluent
      class SomeOutput < Output
        # First, register the plugin. NAME is the name of this plugin
        # and identifies the plugin in the configuration file.
        Fluent::Plugin.register_output('NAME', self)
  
        # This method is called before starting.
        def configure(conf)
          super
          ...
        end
      
        # This method is called when starting.
        def start
          super
          ...
        end
      
        # This method is called when shutting down.
        def shutdown
          super
          ...
        end
      
        # This method is called when an event reaches Fluentd.
        # 'es' is a Fluent::EventStream object that includes multiple events.
        # You can use 'es.each {|time,record| ... }' to retrieve events.
        # 'chain' is an object that manages transactions. Call 'chain.next' at
        # appropriate points and rollback if it raises an exception.
        #
        # NOTE! This method is called by Fluentd's main thread so you should not write slow routine here. It causes Fluentd's performance degression.
        def emit(tag, es, chain)
          chain.next
          es.each {|time,record|
            log.info "OK!"
          }
        end
      end
    end

## Filter Plugins

This section shows how to write custom filters in addition to [the core filter plugins](filter-plugin-overview). The plugin files whose names start with "filter_" are registered as filter plugins.

Here is the implementation of the most basic filter that passes through all events as-is:

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/filter'

    module Fluent
      class PassThruFilter < Filter
        # Register this filter as "passthru"
        Fluent::Plugin.register_filter('passthru', self)

        # config_param works like other plugins

        def configure(conf)
          super
          # do the usual configuration here
        end

        def start
          super
          # This is the first method to be called when it starts running
          # Use it to allocate resources, etc.
        end

        def shutdown
          super
          # This method is called when Fluentd is shutting down.
          # Use it to free up resources, etc.
        end

        def filter(tag, time, record)
          # This method implements the filtering logic for individual filters
          # It is internal to this class and called by filter_stream unless
          # the user overrides filter_stream.
          #
          # Since our example is a pass-thru filter, it does nothing and just
          # returns the record as-is.
          # If returns nil, that records are ignored.
          record
        end
      end
    end

In `initialize`, `configure`, `start` and `shutdown`, `super` should be called to call Filter plugin default behaviour.

See [Writing Input plugins](/articles/plugin-development#writing-input-plugins) section for the details of `tag`, `time` and `record`.

### filter_stream method

Almost plugins could be implemented by overriding `filter` method. But if you want to mutate the event stream itself, you can override `filter_stream` method.

Here is the default implementation of `filter_stream`.

    :::ruby
    def filter_stream(tag, es)
      new_es = MultiEventStream.new
      es.each { |time, record|
        begin
          filtered_record = filter(tag, time, record)
          new_es.add(time, filtered_record) if filtered_record
        rescue => e
          router.emit_error_event(tag, time, record, e)
        end
      }
      new_es
    end

`filter_stream` should return [EventStream](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/lib/fluent/event.rb) object.

## Parser Plugins

Fluentd supports [pluggable, customizable formats for input plugins](parser-plugin-overview). The plugin files whose names start with "parser_" are registered as Parser Plugins.

Here is an example of a custom parser that parses the following newline-delimited log format:

    :::text
    <timestamp><SPACE>key1=value1<DELIMITER>key2=value2<DELIMITER>key3=value...

e.g., something like this

    :::text
    2014-04-01T00:00:00 name=jake age=100 action=debugging

While it is not hard to write a regular expression to match this format, it is tricky to extract and save key names.

Here is the code to parse this custom format (let's call it `time_key_value`). It takes one optional parameter called `delimiter`, which is the delimiter for key-value pairs. It also takes `time_format` to parse the time string. In `initialize`, `configure` and `start`, `super` should be called to call Parser plugin default behaviour.

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/parser'

    module Fluent
      class TextParser
        class TimeKeyValueParser < Parser
          # Register this parser as "time_key_value"
          Plugin.register_parser("time_key_value", self)

          config_param :delimiter, :string, :default => " " # delimiter is configurable with " " as default
          config_param :time_format, :string, :default => nil # time_format is configurable

          # This method is called after config_params have read configuration parameters
          def configure(conf)
            super

            if @delimiter.length != 1
              raise ConfigError, "delimiter must be a single character. #{@delimiter} is not."
            end

            # TimeParser class is already given. It takes a single argument as the time format
            # to parse the time string with.
            @time_parser = TimeParser.new(@time_format)
          end
          
          # This is the main method. The input "text" is the unit of data to be parsed.
          # If this is the in_tail plugin, it would be a line. If this is for in_syslog,
          # it is a single syslog message.
          def parse(text)
            time, key_values = text.split(" ", 2)
            time = @time_parser.parse(time)
            record = {}
            key_values.split(@delimiter).each { |kv|
              k, v = kv.split("=", 2)
              record[k] = v
            }
            yield time, record
          end
        end
      end
    end

Then, save this code in `parser_time_key_value.rb` in a loadable plugin path. Then, if in_tail is configured as

    :::text
    # Other lines...
    <source>
      @type tail
      path /path/to/input/file
      format time_key_value
    </source>

Then, the log line like `2014-01-01T00:00:00 k=v a=b` is parsed as `2013-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 test: {"k":"v","a":"b"}`.

### Parser API

Current `Parser#parse` API is called with block. We will remove `Parser#parse` with return value API since v0.14 or later.

    :::ruby
    # OK
    parser.parse(text) { |time, record| ... }
    # NG. This API will be removed
    time, record = parser.parse(text) # or parser.call(text)

## Text Formatter Plugins

Fluentd supports [pluggable, customizable formats for output plugins](formatter-plugin-overview). The plugin files whose names start with "formatter_" are registered as Formatter Plugins.

Here is an example of a custom formatter that outputs events as CSVs. It takes a required parameter called "csv_fields" and outputs the fields. It assumes that the values of the fields are already valid CSV fields. In `initialize`, `configure` and `start`, `super` should be called to call Formatter plugin default behaviour.

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/formatter'

    module Fluent
      module TextFormatter
        class MyCSVFormatter < Formatter
          # Register MyCSVFormatter as "my_csv".
          Plugin.register_formatter("my_csv", self)

          include HandleTagAndTimeMixin # If you wish to use tag_key, time_key, etc.          
          config_param :csv_fields, :array, value_type: :string

          # This method does further processing. Configuration parameters can be
          # accessed either via "conf" hash or member variables.
          def configure(conf)
            super
          end

          # This is the method that formats the data output.
          def format(tag, time, record)
            values = []

            # Look up each required field and collect them from the record
            @csv_fields.each do |field|
              v = record[field]
              if not v
                $log.error "#{field} is missing."
              end
              values << v
            end

            # Output by joining the fields with a comma
            values.join(",")
          end
        end        
      end
    end

Then, save this code in `formatter_my_csv.rb` in a loadable plugin path. Then, if out_file is configured as

    :::text
    # Other lines...
    <match test>
      @type file
      path /path/to/output/file
      format my_csv
      csv_fields k1,k2
    </match>

and if the record `{"k1": 100, "k2": 200}` is matched, the output file should look like `100,200`

## config_param

`config_param` helper defines plugin parameter. You don't need to parse parameters manually.
`config_param` syntax is `config_param :name, :type, options`. Here is simple example:

    :::text
    config_param :param1, :string
    config_param :param2, :integer, default: 10

In this example, `param1` is required string parameter. If a user doesn't specify `param1`, fluentd raises an `ConfigError`.<br />
On the other hand, `param2` is optional integer parameter. If a user doesn't specify `param2`, fluentd set `10` to `param2` automatically.
If a user sets "5" to `param2` parameter, fluentd converts it into integer type automatically.

### Access parameter value

`config_param` sets parsed result to `:name` instance variable after `configure` call. See example below:

    :::text
    config_param :param, :string
    
    def configure(conf)
      super # This super is needed to parse conf by config_param
      
      p @param # You can access parsed result via instance variable. :param is used for variable name
    end

### Supported types

Fluentd supports following built-in types for plugin parameter:

    :::text
    # hello, /path/to/file, etc
    config_param :str_param, :string
    # -1, 100, 100000, etc
    config_param :int_param, :integer
    # 0.1, 999.9, etc
    config_param :float_param, :float
    # true: yes / true, false: no / false
    config_param :bool_param, :bool
    # json object: {"k":"v"}, {"k", 10}
    config_param :hash_param, :hash
    # json array: [1, 10], ["foo", "bar"]
    config_param :array_param, :array, value_type: :integer
    # integer with size unit: 1k, 2m, 3g, 4t
    config_param :size_param, :size
    # integer with time unit: 1s, 2m, 3h, 4d
    config_param :time_param, :time
    # fixed list with `list` option: [:text, :gzip]
    config_param :enum_param, :enum, list: [:tcp, :udp]

### Supported options

- `default`: Specified parameter becomes optional. `type` value or `nil` are available: `default: 10`, `default: nil`.
- `secret`: Specified parameter is masked when dump a configuration, e.g. start logs, in_monitor_agent result: `secret: true`
- `deprecated`: Specified parameter is showed in warning log. Need deprecated message for value: `deprecated: "Use xxx instead"`
- `obsoleted`: Specified parameter is showed in error log with configuration error. Need obsoleted message for value: `obsoleted: "Use xxx instead"`

These options can be combined.

    :::text
    config_param :param, :array, default: [1, 2], secret: true, deprecated: "Use new_param instead"

## Debugging plugins

Run ``fluentd`` with the ``-vv`` option to show debug messages:

    :::term
    $ fluentd -vv

The **stdout** and **copy** output plugins are useful for debugging. The **stdout** output plugin dumps matched events to the console. It can be used as follows:

    :::text
    # You want to debug this plugin.
    <source>
      @type your_custom_input_plugin
    </source>
    
    # Dump all events to stdout.
    <match **>
      @type stdout
    </match>

The **copy** output plugin copies matched events to multiple output plugins. You can use it in conjunction with the stdout plugin:

    :::text
    <source>
      @type forward
    </source>

    # Use the forward Input plugin and the fluent-cat command to feed events:
    #  $ echo '{"event":"message"}' | fluent-cat test.tag
    <match test.tag>
      @type copy

      # Dump the matched events.
      <store>
        @type stdout
      </store>

      # Feed the dumped events to your plugin.
      <store>
        @type your_custom_output_plugin
      </store>
    </match>

You can use **stdout** filter instead of **copy** and **stdout** combination. The result is same as above but more simpler.

    :::text
    <source>
      @type forward
    </source>

    <filter>
      @type stdout
    </filter>

    <match test.tag>
      @type your_custom_output_plugin
    </match>
