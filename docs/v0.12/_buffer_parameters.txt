## Buffered Output Parameters
For advanced usage, you can tune Fluentd's internal buffering mechanism with these parameters.

### buffer_type
The buffer type is `memory` by default ([buf_memory](buf_memory)) for the ease of testing, however `file` ([buf_file](buf_file)) buffer type is always recommended for the production deployments. If you use `file` buffer type, `buffer_path` parameter is required.

### buffer_queue_limit, buffer_chunk_limit
The length of the chunk queue and the size of each chunk, respectively. Please see the [Buffer Plugin Overview](buffer-plugin-overview) article for the basic buffer structure. The default values are 64 and 8m, respectively. The suffixes “k” (KB), “m” (MB), and “g” (GB) can be used for buffer_chunk_limit.

### flush_interval
The interval between data flushes. The default is 60s. The suffixes “s” (seconds), “m” (minutes), and “h” (hours) can be used.

### flush_at_shutdown
If set to true, Fluentd waits for the buffer to flush at shutdown. By default, it is set to true for Memory Buffer and false for File Buffer.

### retry_wait, max_retry_wait
The initial and maximum intervals between write retries.  The default values are 1.0 seconds and unset (no limit).  The interval doubles (with +/-12.5% randomness) every retry until `max_retry_wait` is reached.

Since td-agent will retry 17 times before giving up by default (see the `retry_limit` parameter for details), the sleep interval can be up to approximately 131072 seconds (roughly 36 hours) in the default configurations.

### retry_limit, disable_retry_limit
The limit on the number of retries before buffered data is discarded, and an
option to disable that limit (if true, the value of `retry_limit` is ignored and
there is no limit).  The default values are 17 and false (not disabled). If the limit is reached, buffered data is discarded and the retry interval is reset to its initial value (`retry_wait`).

### num_threads
The number of threads to flush the buffer. This option can be used to parallelize writes into the output(s) designated by the output plugin. Increasing the number of threads improves the flush throughput to hide write / network latency. The default is 1.

### slow_flush_log_threshold
The threshold for checking chunk flush performance. The default value is `20.0` seconds. Note that parameter type is `float`, not `time`.

If chunk flush takes longer time than this threshold, fluentd logs warning message like below:

    2016-12-19 12:00:00 +0000 [warn]: buffer flush took longer time than slow_flush_log_threshold: elapsed_time = 15.0031226690043695 slow_flush_log_threshold=10.0 plugin_id="foo"
