# stdout Filter Plugin

The `filter_stdout` filter plugin prints events to stdout (or logs if launched
with daemon mode). This filter plugin is useful for debugging purposes.

## Example Configurations

`filter_stdout` is included in Fluentd's core. No installation required.

    :::text
    <filter pattern>
      @type stdout
    </filter>

A sample output is as follows:

```
2015-05-02 12:12:17 +0900 tag: {"field1":"value1","field2":"value2"}
```

where the first part shows the output time, the second part shows the tag,
and the third part shows the record.

NOTE: The first part shows the **output** time, not the time attribute
of message event structure as `out_stdout` does.

## Parameters

#### type (required)
The value must be `stdout`.

#### format
The format of the output. The default is `stdout`.

#### output_type
This is the option of `stdout` format. Configure the format of record (third
part). Any formatter plugins can be specified. The default is `json`.
