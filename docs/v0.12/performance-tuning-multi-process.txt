# Performance Tuning (Multi Process)

This article desdrivbes how to optimize Fluentd's performance with [in_multiprocess](in_multiprocess) plugin. With high traffic, Fluentd tends to be more CPU bound.

However with Ruby MRI's GVL (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock">Global VM Lock</a>) limitation, Fluentd can use only single CPU core. With in_multiprocessm Fluentd can fully utilize multiple CPU cores to handle more requests.

Before you have multi-process configuration, please make sure you have done [all the optimization you can do with single process](performance-tuning-single-process).

## 2-Tier Process Topology

In multi-process environment, we recommend to have the following 2-tier process topology within the same server.

<img src="/images/multi_process_topology.png" width="100%"/>


### 1st Tier: Input Processes

These processes will be in charge for input (typicall either [in_tail](in_tail) or other input plugins) and its parsing. The input processes will transfer all the records to 2nd tier output processes, by [out_forward](out_forward).

In the config, it will be recommended to use shorter `flush_interval` (e.g. 1s) with smaller `buffer_chunk_size` (e.g. 1MB) to immediately forward incoming data to 2nd tier output processes.

### 2nd Tier: Output Processes

These process will be in charge for filter and output to your favorite destinations. The output processes accept incoming data from input processes, by [in_forward](in_forward).

The output processes are shared across all input processes, by out_forward's load balancing mechanism. In this way, you can simply add more output processes to handle more capacity across all inputs.

### Reasons behind this Design

There are coupole of reasons why we recommend this design.

#### Focus

Each process can use nearly 100% of its CPU with much smaller focus (either input or output). For example, `in_tail` can now focus on tailing and parsing, rather than sharing the CPU power for filtering and output.

#### Scale

To handle more volume, you can simply add more input and output processes. `in_forward` and `out_forward` automatically distribute the load across the processes automatically.

#### Robust

If any of the process goes down, the supervisor process will automatically relaunch the process. Also we recommend to use [buf_file](buf_file) for both input and output processes, to simply prevent losing the data.

For example, even if one of the output processes die, the data gets buffered and routed to different output processes automatically. Also crashed processes will be automaticlaly relaunched by supervisor process.

## Example Configuration

This git repository contains the fully functional multi-process settings for Fluentd.

* [Fluentd Multi-Process Example Configuration (Githib)](https://github.com/kzk/fluentd-multiprocess-config-example)

You can simply test with `td-agent`, or directly use Ruby to launch Fluentd.

    :::term
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec fluentd -c fluentd.conf

### Files

#### fluentd.conf (Supervisor)

This config uses `in_multiprocess` to launch both input and output processes.

#### in_*.conf (1st Tier Input Processes)

The example config contains 3 input processes: `in_tcp1.conf`, `in_tcp2.conf`, and `in_udp1.conf`.

These input processes will focus on receiving the data via either TCP or UDP, and sipmly forward to 2nd tier output processes.

#### out_*.conf (2nd Tier Output Processes)

The example config contains 4 output processes: `out1.conf`, `out2.conf`, `out3.conf`, `out4.conf`.

These output processes receive data from input processes, apply filters, and output to the destinations.

`./tmpl/` directory has the config generation script, in case you'd like to increase the processes.

    :::term
    $ bash gen_out.sh

#### monitoring_*.conf (Monitoring)

These files are used to collect metrics from Fluentd, and exposing the metrics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring system. The repository also has `./prometheus` directory, which contains example `prometheus.yml` configuration.

### How to add input processes?

Please add `in_xyz.conf`. Please make sure you have `<match>` section, to forward incoming data to 2nd tier output processes. Finally, register the process in `fluentd.conf`.

### How to add output processes?

Please add `out_N.conf`, and register the process in both `options_forward.conf` and `fluentd.conf` which list up all the output processes.

### How many processes should we have?

We recommend to have approximately similar number of total processes with your CPU cores.

When you perform the benchmark, please carefully look at which processes are the bottleneck. Please add the processes depending on its resource usages.

## Fluentd v1.0 or Later

Fluentd v1.0 or later has native multi-process support. We recommend you to upgrade to simplify the config file if possible.
