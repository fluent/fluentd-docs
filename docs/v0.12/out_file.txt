# file Output Plugin

The `out_file` TimeSliced Output plugin writes events to files. By default, it creates files on a daily basis (around 00:10). This means that when you first import records using the plugin, no file is created immediately. The file will be created when the `time_slice_format` condition has been met. To change the output frequency, please modify the `time_slice_format` value.

## Example Configuration

`out_file` is included in Fluentd's core. No additional installation process is required.

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      @type file
      path /var/log/fluent/myapp
      time_slice_format %Y%m%d
      time_slice_wait 10m
      time_format %Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z
      compress gzip
      utc
    </match>

NOTE: Please see the <a href="config-file">Config File</a> article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

## Parameters

### type (required)
The value must be `file`.

### path (required)
The Path of the file. The actual path is path + time + ”.log”. The time portion is determined by the time_slice_format parameter, descried below.

The `path` parameter is used as `buffer_path` in this plugin.

NOTE: Initially, you may see a file which looks like "/path/to/file.20140101.log.b4eea2c8166b147a0". This is an intermediate buffer file ("b4eea2c8166b147a0" identifies the buffer). Once the content of the buffer has been completely <a href="buf_file">flushed</a>, you will see the output file without the trailing identifier.

### append
The flushed chunk is appended to existence file or not. The default is `false`.
By default, out_file flushes each chunk to different path.

    :::text
    # append false
    log.20140608_0.log
    log.20140608_1.log
    log.20140609_0.log
    log.20140609_1.log

This makes parallel file processing easy. But if you want to disable this behaviour,
you can disable it by setting `append true`.

    :::text
    # append true
    log.20140608.log
    log.20140609.log


### format
The format of the file content. The default is `out_file`.

INCLUDE: _formatter_parameters

### time_format
The format of the time written in files. The default format is ISO-8601.

### utc
Uses UTC for path formatting. The default format is localtime.

### compress
Compresses flushed files using `gzip`. No compression is performed by default.

### symlink_path

Create symlink to temporary buffered file when `buffer_type` is `file`. No symlink is created by default.
This is useful for tailing file content to check logs.
