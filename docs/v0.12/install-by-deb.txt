# Installing Fluentd Using deb Package

This article explains how to install the td-agent deb package, the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/).

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive parts written in C. However, some users may have difficulty installing and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is providing **the stable community distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found <a href="//www.fluentd.org/faqs">here</a>.

Currently, td-agent 2 deb has two versions, td-agent 2.5 / td-agent 2.3. The different point is bundled ruby version. td-agent 2.5 or later uses ruby 2.5 and td-agent 2.3 or earlier uses ruby 2.1. ruby 2.1 is EOL so we recommend to use td-agent 2.5 for new deployment. td-agent 2.5 and td-agent 2.3 use fluentd v0.12 serise so the behaviour is same.

## Step 0: Before Installation

Please follow the [Preinstallation Guide](before-install) to configure your OS properly. This will prevent many unnecessary problems.

## Step 1 : Install from Apt Repository

For Ubuntu, we currently support "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS / Bionic 64bit", "Ubuntu 16.04 LTS / Xenial 64bit", "Ubuntu 14.04 LTS / Trusty 64bit/32bit", "Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Precise 64bit/32bit", "Ubuntu 10.04 LTS / Lucid 64bit/32bit".

For Debian, we currently support Jessie, Wheezy and Squeeze. There is no 32bit packages for Debian.

NOTE: We might not provide td-agent for older distributions. For example, we don't provide latest td-agent version for squeeze and lucid for now.

A shell script is provided to automate the installation process for each version. The shell script registers a new apt repository at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/treasure-data.list` and installs the `td-agent` deb package.

For Bionic,

    :::term
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-bionic-td-agent2.5.sh | sh

For Xenial,

    :::term
    # td-agent 2.5 or later
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-xenial-td-agent2.5.sh | sh
    # td-agent 2.3 or earlier
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-xenial-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Trusty,

    :::term
    # td-agent 2.5 or later
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-trusty-td-agent2.5.sh | sh
    # td-agent 2.3 or earlier
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-trusty-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Precise,

    :::term
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-precise-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Lucid,

    :::term
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-lucid-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Debian Stretch,

    :::term
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-debian-stretch-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Debian Jessie,

    :::term
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-debian-jessie-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Debian Wheezy,

    :::term
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-debian-wheezy-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Debian Squeeze,

    :::term
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-debian-squeeze-td-agent2.sh | sh

It's HIGHLY recommended that you set up <b>ntpd</b> on the node to prevent invalid timestamps in your logs. Please check the [Preinstallation Guide](before-install).

## Step2: Launch Daemon

The `/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent status
    td-agent (pid  21678) is running...

The following commands are supported:

    :::term
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent start
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent status

Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.

## Step3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and route them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`). You can post sample log records using the curl command.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
