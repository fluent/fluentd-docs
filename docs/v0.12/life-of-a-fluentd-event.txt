# Life of a Fluentd event

The following article describe a global overview of how events are processed by [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org) using examples. It covers the complete cycle including _Setup_, _Inputs_, _Filters_, _Matches_ and _Labels_.

## Basic Setup

The configuration files is the fundamental piece to connect all things together, as it allows to define which _Inputs_ or listeners [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org) will have and set up common matching rules to route the _Event_ data to a specific _Output_.

We will use the [in_http](in_http) and the [out_stdout](out_stdout) plugins as examples to describe the events cycle. The following is a basic definition on the configuration file to specify an _http_ input, for short: we will be listening for __HTTP Requests__:

    :::text
    <source>
      @type http
      port 8888
      bind 0.0.0.0
    </source>

This definition specifies that a HTTP server will be listening on TCP port 8888. Now let's define a _Matching_ rule and a desired output that will just print the data that arrived on each incoming request to standard output:

    :::text
    <match test.cycle>
      @type stdout
    </match>

The _Match_ directive sets a rule that matches each _Incoming_ event that arrives with a __Tag__ equal to _test.cycle_ will use the _Output_ plugin type called _stdout_. At this point we have an _Input_ type, a _Match_ and an _Output_. Let's test the setup using _curl_:

    :::text
    $ curl -i -X POST -d 'json={"action":"login","user":2}' http://localhost:8888/test.cycle
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-type: text/plain
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Content-length: 0

On the [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org) server side the output should look like this:

    :::text
    $ bin/fluentd -c in_http.conf
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: reading config file path="in_http.conf"
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: starting fluentd-0.12.3
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: using configuration file: <ROOT>
      <source>
        @type http
        bind 0.0.0.0
        port 8888
      </source>
      <match test.cycle>
        @type stdout
      </match>
    </ROOT>
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: adding match pattern="test.cycle" type="stdout"
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: adding source type="http"
    2015-01-19 12:39:57 -0600 test.cycle: {"action":"login","user":2}

## Event structure

A Fluentd event consists of a tag, time and record.

- tag: Where an event comes from. For message routing
- time: When an event happens. Epoch time
- record: Actual log content. JSON object

The input plugin is responsible for generating Fluentd events from specified data sources.<br />
For example, `in_tail` generates events from text lines. If you have the following line in apache logs:

    :::text
    192.168.0.1 - - [28/Feb/2013:12:00:00 +0900] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 777

the following event is generated:

    :::text
    tag: apache.access # set by configuration
    time: 1362020400   # 28/Feb/2013:12:00:00 +0900
    record: {"user":"-","method":"GET","code":200,"size":777,"host":"192.168.0.1","path":"/"}

## Processing Events

When a _Setup_ is defined, the _Router Engine_ already contains several rules to apply for different input data. Internally an _Event_ will pass through a chain of procedures that may alter the _Events_ cycle.

Now we will expand the previous basic example and add more steps in our _Setup_ to demonstrate how the _Events_ cycle can be altered. We will do this through the new _Filters_ implementation.

### Filters

A _Filter_ aims to behave like a rule to either accept or reject an event. The following configuration adds a _Filter_ definition:

    :::text
    <source>
      @type http
      port 8888
      bind 0.0.0.0
    </source>

    <filter test.cycle>
      @type grep
      exclude1 action logout
    </filter>

    <match test.cycle>
      @type stdout
    </match>

As you can see, the new _Filter_ definition added will be a mandatory step before passing control to the _Match_ section. The _Filter_ basically accepts or rejects the _Event_ based on it _type_ and the defined rule. For our example we want to discard any user `logout` action, we only care about the `login` action. The way this is accomplished is by the _Filter_ doing a `grep` that will exclude any message where the `action` key has the string value "logout".

From a _Terminal_, run the following two `curl` commands (please note that each one contains a different `action` value):

    :::text
    $ curl -i -X POST -d 'json={"action":"login","user":2}' http://localhost:8888/test.cycle
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-type: text/plain
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Content-length: 0

    $ curl -i -X POST -d 'json={"action":"logout","user":2}' http://localhost:8888/test.cycle
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-type: text/plain
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Content-length: 0

Now looking at the [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org) service output we can see that only the event with `action` equal to "login" is matched. The `logout` _Event_ was discarded:

    :::text
    $ bin/fluentd -c in_http.conf
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: reading config file path="in_http.conf"
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: starting fluentd-0.12.4
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: using configuration file: <ROOT>
    <source>
      @type http
      bind 0.0.0.0
      port 8888
    </source>
    <filter test.cycle>
      @type grep
      exclude1 action logout
    </filter>
    <match test.cycle>
      @type stdout
    </match>
    </ROOT>
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: adding filter pattern="test.cycle" type="grep"
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: adding match pattern="test.cycle" type="stdout"
    2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: adding source type="http"
    2015-01-27 01:27:11 -0600 test.cycle: {"action":"login","user":2}

As you can see, the _Events_ follow a _step-by-step cycle_ where they are processed in order from top to bottom. The new engine on [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org) allows integrating as many _Filters_ as needed. Considering that the configuration file might grow and start getting a bit complex, a new feature called _Labels_ has been added that aims to help manage this complexity.

### Labels

The _Labels_ implementation aims to reduce configuration file complexity and allows to define new _Routing_ sections that do not follow the _top to bottom_ order, instead acting like linked references. Using the previous example we will modify the setup as follows:

    :::text
    <source>
      @type http
      bind 0.0.0.0
      port 8888
      @label @STAGING
    </source>

    <filter test.cycle>
      @type grep
      exclude1 action login
    </filter>

    <label @STAGING>
      <filter test.cycle>
        @type grep
        exclude1 action logout
      </filter>

      <match test.cycle>
        @type stdout
      </match>
    </label>

This new configuration contains a `@label` key on the `source` indicating that any further steps take place on the _STAGING_ _Label_ section. Every _Event_ reported on the _Source_ is routed by the _Routing_ engine and continue processing on _STAGING_, skipping the old filter definition.

### Buffers

In this example, we use `stdout` non-buffered output, but in production buffered outputs are often necessary, e.g. `forward`, `mongodb`, `s3` and etc.
Buffered output plugins store received events into buffers and are then written out to a destination after meeting flush conditions.
Using buffered output you don't see recieved events immediately, unlike `stdout` non-buffered output.

Buffers are important for reliability and throughput. See [Output](output-plugin-overview) and [Buffer](buffer-plugin-overview) articles.

## Execution unit

This section describes the internal implementation.

Fluentd's events are processed on input plugin thread by default.
For example, if you have `in_tail -> filter_grep -> out_stdout` pipeline, this pipeline is executed on in_tail's thread.
The important point is `filter_grep` and `out_stdout` plugins don't have own thread for processing.

For Buffered Output, output plugin has own threads for flushing buffer.
For example, if you have `in_tail -> filter_grep -> out_forward` pipeline, this pipeline is executed on in_tail's thread and out_forward's flush thread. in_tail's thread processes events until events are written into buffer. Buffer flush and its error handling is the output responsibility.
This de-couples the input/output and this model has merits, separate responsibilities, easy error handling, good performance.

## Conclusion

Once the events are reported by the [Fluentd](http://fluend.org) engine on the _Source_ they can be processed _step by step_ or inside a referenced _Label_, with any _Event_ being filtered out at any moment. The new _Routing_ engine behavior aims to provide more flexibility and simplifies the processing before events reach the _Output_ plugin.
