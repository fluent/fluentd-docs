# out_s3 Output Plugin

The `out_s3` plugin is a buffered output plugin used to write records into the Amazon S3 cloud object storage service.

### Installation

td-agent includes the S3 plugin by default. Fluentd users will need to install the fluent-plugin-s3 gem using the following command:

    :::term
    $ fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-s3

### Example Configuration

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      type s3

      aws_key_id YOUR_AWS_KEY_ID
      aws_sec_key YOUR_AWS_SECRET/KEY
      s3_bucket YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
      s3_endpoint s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com
      path logs/
      buffer_path /var/log/fluent/s3

      time_slice_format %Y%m%d-%H
      time_slice_wait 10m
      utc
    </match>

Please refer to the [Store Apache Logs into Amazon S3](apache-to-s3) article for real-world use cases.

NOTE: Please refer to the <a href="config-file">Config File</a> article for more information on the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

NOTE: Files are created on an hourly basis (depending on `time_slice_format`). This means that when you first import records using the plugin, no file is created immediately. The file will be created when the `time_slice_format` condition has been met.

NOTE: Make sure you have <b>enough space in the buffer_path directory</b>. Running out of space is a frequent problem reported by users.

### Parameters
