#### types (optional, v.0.10.42 and up)

Although every parsed field has type `string` by default, you can specify other types. This is useful when filtering particular fields numerically or storing data with sensible type information.

The syntax is

    :::text
    types <field_name_1>:<type_name_1>,<field_name_2>:<type_name_2>,...

e.g.,

    :::text
    types user_id:integer,paid:bool,paid_usd_amount:float

As demonstrated above, "," is used to delimit field-type pairs while ":" is used to separate a field name with its intended type.

Unspecified fields are parsed at the default string type.

The list of supported types are shown below:

* string
* bool
* integer ("int" would NOT work!)
* float
* time
* array

For the `time` and `array` types, there is an optional third field after the type name. For the "time" type, you can specify a time format like you would in `time_format`. 

For the "array" type, the third field specifies the delimiter (the default is ","). For example, if a field called "item_ids" contains the value "3,4,5", `types item_ids:array` parses it as ["3", "4", "5"]. Alternatively, if the value is "Adam|Alice|Bob", `types item_ids:array:|` parses it as ["Adam", "Alice", "Bob"].
