</p>

When I first started at <a href="http://thebackplane.com/">Backplane</a>, I wanted to get us to start logging everything and aggregating it in JSON, and I wanted that system up and running fast. Fluentd got me there in less than a day. I was skeptical of reliability at first, but it takes so little time to setup, there's no reason not to try it.

It hasn't crashed once yet, works exactly as I need it to thanks to the huge plugin library, and likely saved us a ton of time. As an added bonus: the user list for Fluentd was also way more responsive when I ran into initial setup questions than those of any competitors. If you want to start logging your data fast, Fluentd is a great way to go. - Eli Finkelshteyn, Lead Data Scientist

Though collecting and analyzing log data is quite important in our services, we had no choice but to conduct in conventional methods such as using Hadoop to analyze log data or rsync and script.

That is why we began to use Fluentd. Fluentd made it possible to collect existing log with significantly lower resources, while it is not affecting the analyzing process. We introduced this system successfully and safely.

Fluentd helps us collect and analyze an app log and midleware log efficiently. And as a result, it improves our daily operation and services. - Tomomitsu Tsuda, General Manager
