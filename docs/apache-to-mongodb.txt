# Store Apache Logs into MongoDB

This article explains how to use [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/)'s MongoDB Output plugin ([out_mongo](out_mongo)) to aggregate semi-structured logs in real-time.

## Background

[Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/) is an advanced open-source log collector originally developed at [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/). Because Fluentd handles logs as semi-structured data streams, the ideal database should have strong support for semi-structured data. There are several candidates that meet this criterion, but we believe [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is the market leader.

MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented database developed at [10gen, Inc](http://www.10gen.com/). It is schema-free and uses a JSON-like format to manage semi-structured data.

This article will show you how to use [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/) to import Apache logs into MongoDB.

## Mechanism

The figure below shows how things will work.

Fluentd does 3 things:

1. It continuously “tails” the access log file.
2. It parses the incoming log entries into meaningful fields (such as `ip`, `path`, etc.) and buffers them.
3. It writes the buffered data to MongoDB periodically.

## Install

For simplicity, this article will describe how to set up an one-node configuration. Please install the following software on the same node.

* [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/)
* [MongoDB Output Plugin](out_mongo)
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
* Apache (with the Combined Log Format)

The MongoDB Output plugin is included in the latest version of Fluentd’s deb/rpm package. If you want to use Ruby Gems to install the plugin, please use `gem install fluent-plugin-mongo`.

* [Debian Package](install-by-deb)
* [RPM Package](install-by-rpm)
* [Ruby gem](install-by-gem)

For MongoDB, please refer to the following downloads page.

* [MongoDB Downloads](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)

## Configuration

Let’s start configuring Fluentd. If you used the deb/rpm package, Fluentd's config file is located at /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf. Otherwise, it is located at /etc/fluentd/fluentd.conf.

### Tail Input

For the input source, we will set up Fluentd to track the recent Apache logs (typically found at /var/log/apache2/access_log) The Fluentd configuration file should look like this:

    :::text
    <source>
      type tail
      format apache2
      path /var/log/apache2/access_log
      pos_file /var/log/td-agent/apache2.access_log.pos
      tag mongo.apache.access
    </source>

NOTE: Please make sure that your Apache outputs are in the default 'combined' format. `format apache2` cannot parse custom log formats. Please see the <a href="in_tail">in_tail</a> article for more information.

Let’s go through the configuration line by line.

1. `type tail`: The tail Input plugin continuously tracks the log file. This handy plugin is included in Fluentd’s core.
2. `format apache2`: Uses Fluentd’s built-in Apache log parser.
3. `path /var/log/apache2/access_log`: The location of the Apache log. This may be different for your particular system.
4. `tag mongo.apache.access`: `mongo.apache.access` is used as the tag to route the messages within Fluentd.

That’s it! You should now be able to output a JSON-formatted data stream for Fluentd to process.

### MongoDB Output

The output destination will be MongoDB. The output configuration should look like this:

    :::text
    <match mongo.*.*>
      # plugin type
      type mongo

      # mongodb db + collection
      database apache
      collection access

      # mongodb host + port
      host localhost
      port 27017

      # interval
      flush_interval 10s
    </match>

The match section specifies the regexp used to look for matching tags. If a matching tag is found in a log, then the config inside `<match>...</match>` is used (i.e. the log is routed according to the config inside). In this example, the `mongo.apache.access` tag (generated by `tail`) is always used.

The `**` in `match.**` matches zero or more period-delimited tag parts (e.g. match/match.a/match.a.b).

**flush_interval** specifies how often the data is written to MongoDB. The other options specify MongoDB's host, port, db, and collection.

NOTE: For additional configuration parameters, please see the <a href="out_mongo">MongoDB Output plugin</a> article. If you are using ReplicaSet, please see the <a href="out_mongo_replset">MongoDB ReplicaSet Output plugin</a> article.

## Test

To test the configuration, just ping the Apache server. This example uses the `ab` (Apache Bench) program.

    :::term
    $ ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost/

Then, access MongoDB and see the stored data.

    :::term
    $ mongo
    > use apache
    > db["access"].findOne();
    { "_id" : ObjectId("4ed1ed3a340765ce73000001"), "host" : "127.0.0.1", "user" : "-", "method" : "GET", "path" : "/", "code" : "200", "size" : "44", "time" : ISODate("2011-11-27T07:56:27Z") }
    { "_id" : ObjectId("4ed1ed3a340765ce73000002"), "host" : "127.0.0.1", "user" : "-", "method" : "GET", "path" : "/", "code" : "200", "size" : "44", "time" : ISODate("2011-11-27T07:56:34Z") }
    { "_id" : ObjectId("4ed1ed3a340765ce73000003"), "host" : "127.0.0.1", "user" : "-", "method" : "GET", "path" : "/", "code" : "200", "size" : "44", "time" : ISODate("2011-11-27T07:56:34Z") }
