# tail Input Plugin

The `in_tail` Input plugin allows Fluentd to read events from the tail of text files. Its behavior is similar to the `tail -F` command.

### Example Configuration

`in_tail` is included in Fluentd's core. No additional installation process is required.

    :::text
    <source>
      type tail
      path /var/log/httpd-access.log
      pos_file /var/log/td-agent/httpd-access.log.pos
      tag apache.access
      format apache2
    </source>

NOTE: Please see the <a href="config-file">Config File</a> article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

### How it Works

* When Fluentd is first configured with `in_tail`, it will start reading from the **tail** of that log, not the beggining.
* Once the log is rotated, Fluentd starts reading the new file from the beggining. It keeps track of the current inode number.
* If `td-agent` restarts, it starts reading from the last position td-agent read before the restart. This position is recorded in the position file specified by the pos_file parameter.

### Parameters

#### type (required)
The value must be `tail`.

#### path (required)
The paths to read. Multiple paths can be specified, separated by ‘,’.

#### tag (required)
The tag of the event.

#### format (required)
The format of the log. Itis the name of a template or regexp surrounded by ‘/’.

The regexp must have at least one named capture (?&lt;NAME&gt;PATTERN). If the regexp has a capture named ‘time’, it is used as the time of the event. You can specify the time format using the time_format parameter. If the regexp has a capture named ‘tag’, the tag parameter + the captured tag is used as the tag of the event.

The following templates are supported:

* regexp

The regexp for the format parameter can be specified. [Fluentular](http://fluentular.herokuapp.com/) is a great website to test your regexp for Fluentd configuration.

* `apache2`

Reads apache’s log file for the following fields: host, user, time, method, path, code, size, referer and agent. This template is analogous to the following configuration:

    :::text
    format /^(?<host>[^ ]*) [^ ]* (?<user>[^ ]*) \[(?<time>[^\]]*)\] "(?<method>\S+)(?: +(?<path>[^ ]*) +\S*)?" (?<code>[^ ]*) (?<size>[^ ]*)(?: "(?<referer>[^\"]*)" "(?<agent>[^\"]*)")?$/
    time_format %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z

* `syslog`

Reads syslog’s output file (e.g. /var/log/syslog) for the following fields: time, host, ident, and message. This template is analogous to the following configuration:

    :::text
    format /^(?<time>[^ ]* [^ ]* [^ ]*) (?<host>[^ ]*) (?<ident>[a-zA-Z0-9_\/\.\-]*)(?:\[(?<pid>[0-9]+)\])?[^\:]*\: *(?<message>.*)$/
    time_format %b %d %H:%M:%S

* `tsv` or `csv`

If you use tsv or csv format, please also specify the `keys` parameter.

    :::text
    format tsv
    keys key1, key2, key3
    time_key key2

If you specify the `time_key` parameter, it will be used to identify the timestamp of the record. The timestamp when Fluentd reads the record is used by default.

    :::text
    format csv
    keys key1, key2, key3
    time_key key3

* `json`

One JSON map, per line. This is the most straight forward format :).

    :::text
    format json

The `time_key` parameter can also be specified.

    :::text
    format json
    time_key key3

### pos_file (highly recommended)
This parameter is highly recommended. Fluentd will record the position it last read into this file.

    :::text
    pos_file /var/log/td-agent/tmp/access.log.pos

#### time_format
The format of the time field. This parameter is required only if the format includes a ‘time’ capture and it cannot be parsed automatically. Please see [Time#strftime](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Time.html#method-i-strftime) for additional information.

#### rotate_wait
in_tail actually does a bit more than `tail -F` itself. When rotating a file, some data may still need to be written to the old file as opposed to the new one.

in_tail takes care of this by keeping a reference to the old file (even after it has been rotated) for some time before transitioning completely to the new file. This helps prevent data designated for the old file from getting lost. By default, this time interval is 5 seconds.

The rotate_wait parameter accepts a single integer representing the number of seconds you want this time interval to be.
