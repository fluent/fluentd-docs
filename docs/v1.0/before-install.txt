# Before Installing Fluentd

You MUST set up your environment according to the steps below before installing Fluentd. Failing to do so will be the cause of many unnecessary problems.

## Set Up NTP

It's HIGHLY recommended that you set up NTP daemon (e.g. *<a href="https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/">chrony</a>*, *ntpd*, etc) on the node to have accurate current timestamp. This is crucial for any production-grade logging services.

NOTE: For Amazon Web Services users we recommend using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-time.html">AWS hosted NTP server</a>.

## Increase Max # of File Descriptors

Please increase the maximum number of file descriptors. You can check the current number using the `ulimit -n` command.

    :::term
    $ ulimit -n
    65535

If your console shows `1024`, it is insufficient. Please add following lines to your `/etc/security/limits.conf` file and reboot your machine.

    :::term
    root soft nofile 65536
    root hard nofile 65536
    * soft nofile 65536
    * hard nofile 65536

If you are running fluentd under systemd, the option `LimitNOFILE=65536` can also be used (and if you are using the td-agent package this value is setup by default).

## Optimize Network Kernel Parameters

For high load environments consisting of many Fluentd instances, please add these parameters to your `/etc/sysctl.conf` file. Please either type `sysctl -p` or reboot your node to have the changes take effect.

    :::term
    net.core.somaxconn = 1024
    net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 5000
    net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
    net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
    net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 12582912 16777216
    net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 12582912 16777216
    net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 8096
    net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle = 0
    net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
    net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 10240 65535
