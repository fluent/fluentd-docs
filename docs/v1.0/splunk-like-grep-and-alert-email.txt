# Splunk-like Grep-and-Alert-Email System Using Fluentd

[Splunk](http://www.splunk.com/) is a great tool for searching logs. One of its key features is the ability to "grep" logs and send alert emails when certain conditions are met.

In this little "how to" article, we will show you how to build a similar system using Fluentd. More specifically, we will create a system that sends an alert email when it detects a 5xx HTTP status code in an Apache access log.

If you want a more general introduction to use Fluentd as a free alternative to Splunk, see the article ["Free Alternative to Splunk Using Fluentd"](free-alternative-to-splunk-by-fluentd).

## Installing the requisites

[Install](/categories/installation) Fluentd if you haven't yet.

Please install `fluent-plugin-grepcounter` by running:

    :::term
    $ sudo /usr/sbin/td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-grepcounter

Next, please install `fluent-plugin-mail` by running:

    :::term
    $ sudo /usr/sbin/td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-mail

Note: If you installed Fluentd using ruby gems, use `gem` command instead of `td-agent-gem`.

## Configuration

### Full configuration example

Below shows the full configuration example. You can copy the following content and edit it to suit your needs.

    :::text
    <source>
      @type tail
      path /var/log/apache2/access.log  # Set the location of your log file
      <parse>
        @type apache2
      </parse>
      tag apache.access
    </source>

    <match apache.access>
      @type grepcounter
      count_interval 3  # The time window for counting errors (in secs)
      input_key code    # The field to apply the regular expression
      regexp ^5\d\d$    # The regular expression to be applied
      threshold 1       # The minimum number of erros to trigger an alart
      add_tag_prefix error_5xx  # Generate tags like "error_5xx.apache.access"
    </match>
    
    <match error_5xx.apache.access>
      @type copy
      <store>
        @type stdout  # Print to stdout for debugging
      </store>
      <store>
        @type mail
        host smtp.gmail.com        # Change this to your SMTP server host
        port 587                   # Normally 25/587/465 are used for submission
        user USERNAME              # Use your username to log in
        password PASSWORD          # Use your login password
        enable_starttls_auto true  # Use this option to enable STARTTLS
        from example@gmail.com     # Set the sender address
        to alart@example.com       # Set the recipient address
        subject 'HTTP SERVER ERROR'
        message Total 5xx error count: %s\n\nPlease check your Apache webserver ASAP
        message_out_keys count     # Use the "count" field to replace "%s" above
      </store>
    </match>

Save your settings to `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` (If you installed Fluentd without td-agent, save the content as 'alert-email.conf' instead).

Please make sure your SMTP configuration is correct before continuing. Otherwise, you will get warnings when you try to run this example.

### How this configuration works

The configuration above consists of three main parts:

  1. The first `<source>` block sets the httpd log file as an event source for the daemon.

  2. The second `<match>` block tells Fluentd to count the number of 5xx responses per time window (3 seconds). If the number exceeds (or is equal to) the given threshold, Fluentd will emit an event with the tag `error_5xx.apache.access`.

  3. The third `<match>` block accepts events with the tag `error_5xx.apache.access`, and send an email to `alart@example.com` per event.

In this way, fluentd now works as an email alerting system that monitors the web service for you.

## Test the configuration

After saving the configuration, restart the td-agent process:

    :::term
    # for init.d users
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    # for systemd users
    $ sudo systemctl restart td-agent

If you installed the standalone version of Fluentd, launch the fluentd process manually:

    $ fluentd -c alart-email.conf

Then generate some 5xx errors in the web server. If you do not have a convenient way to accomplish this, appending 5xx lines to the log file manually will produce the same result.

Now you will receive an alert email titled "HTTP SERVER ERROR".

## What's next?

Admittedly, this is a contrived example. In reality, you would set the threshold higher. Also, you might be interested in tracking 4xx pages as well. In addition to Apache logs, Fluentd can handle Nginx logs, syslogs, or any single- or multi-lined logs.
