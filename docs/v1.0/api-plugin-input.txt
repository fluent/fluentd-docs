# Writing Input Plugins

Extend the **Fluent::Plugin::Input** class and implement the following methods. See LINK:[Plugin Base Class API](api-plugin-base) to show details of common API for all plugin types.

In most cases, input plugins start timers, threads or network servers to listen any ports in `#start`, then call `router.emit` to emit events in callbacks of timers, threads or network servers.

    :::ruby
    require 'fluent/plugin/input'

    module Fluent::Plugin
      class SomeInput < Input
        # First, register the plugin. NAME is the name of this plugin
        # and identifies the plugin in the configuration file.
        Fluent::Plugin.register_input('NAME', self)
  
        # config_param defines a parameter. You can refer a parameter via @port instance variable
        # :default means this parameter is optional
        config_param :port, :integer, default: 8888
  
        # This method is called before starting.
        # 'conf' is a Hash that includes configuration parameters.
        # If the configuration is invalid, raise Fluent::ConfigError.
        def configure(conf)
          super
  
          # configured "port" is referred by `@port` or instance method #port
          if @port < 1024
            raise Fluent::ConfigError, "well known ports cannot be used for this purpose."
          end

          # You can also refer to raw parameter via conf[name].
          @port = conf['port']
          ...
        end
  
        # This method is called when starting.
        # Open sockets or files and create a thread here.
        def start
          super

          # my own start-up code
        end
  
        # This method is called when shutting down.
        def shutdown
          # my own shutdown code

          super
        end
      end
    end

To submit events, use the ``router.emit(tag, time, record)`` method, where ``tag`` is the String, ``time`` is the Fluent::EventTime (or Integer as unix time) and ``record`` is a Hash object.

    :::ruby
    tag = "myapp.access"
    time = Fluent::Engine.now
    record = {"message"=>"body"}
    router.emit(tag, time, record)

To submit multiple events in one call, use the ``router.emit_stream(tag, es)`` and ``MultiEventStream`` combo instead.

    :::ruby
    es = MultiEventStream.new
    records.each { |record|
      es.add(time, record)
    }
    router.emit_stream(tag, es)

### Record format

Fluentd plugins assume the record is a JSON so the key should be the String, not Symbol.
If you emit a symbol keyed record, it may cause a problem.

    :::ruby
    router.emit(tag, time, {'foo' => 'bar'})  # OK!
    router.emit(tag, time, {:foo => 'bar'})   # NG!

## Methods

There are no specific method for Input plugins.

## Writing Tests

Fluentd input plugin has just one or some points to be tested. Others (parsing configurations, controlling buffers, retries, flushes and many others) are controlled by Fluentd core.

Fluentd also provides test driver for plugins. You can write tests of your own plugins very easily:

    :::ruby
    # test/plugin/test_in_your_own.rb
    
    require 'test/unit'
    require 'fluent/test/driver/input'

    # your own plugin
    require 'fluent/plugin/in_your_own'

    class YourOwnInputTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      def setup
        Fluent::Test.setup  # this is required to setup router and others
      end

      # default configuration for tests
      CONFIG = %[
        param1 value1
        param2 value2
      ]

      def create_driver(conf = CONFIG)
        Fluent::Test::Driver::Input.new(Fluent::Plugin::YourOwnInput).configure(conf)
      end

      sub_test_case 'configured with invalid configurations' do
        test 'param1 should reject too short string' do
          assert_raise Fluent::ConfigError do
            create_driver(%[
              param1 a
            ])
          end
        end

        test 'param2 is set correctly' do
          d = create_driver
          assert_equal "value2", d.instance.param2
        end

        # ...
      end

      sub_test_case 'plugin will emit some events' do
        test 'test expects plugin emits events 4 times' do
          d = create_driver

          d.run(expect_emits: 4, timeout: 10)
          # this method blocks until input plugin emits events 4 times
          # or 10 seconds passes

          events = d.events # array of [tag, time, record]
          assert_equal "expected_tag", events[0][0]
          # ...
        end
      end

      # ...
    end

### Overview of Tests

Testing for input plugins are mainly for:

* Configuration/Validation checks for invalid configurations (about ``#configure``)
* Checks for emitted events by input plugins

Plugin test driver provides dummy router, logger and feature to override system configurations, and configuration parser and others to make it easy to test configuration errors or others.

Lifecycle of plugins and test drivers is:

1. Instantiate plugin driver (and it instantiates plugin)
2. Configure plugin
3. Register conditions to stop/break running tests
4. Run test code (provided as a block for ``d.run``)
5. Assert results of tests by data provided from driver

Test drivers calls methods for plugin lifecycles at the beginning of 4. (``#start``) and the end of 4. (``#stop``, ``#shutdown``, ...). It can be skipped by optional arguments of ``#run``. See LINK:[Testing API for plugins](api-plugin-test) for details.

For configuration tests, repeat 1-2. For full feature tests, repeat 1-5. Test drivers and helper methods will support it.
