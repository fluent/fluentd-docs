# Elasticsearch Output Plugin

The `out_elasticsearch` Output plugin writes records into Elasticsearch. By default, it creates records by bulk write operation. This means that when you first import records using the plugin, no record is created immediately.

The record will be created when the `chunk_keys` condition has been met. To change the output frequency, please specify the `time` in chunk_keys and specify `timekey` value in conf.

NOTE: This document doesn't describe all parameters. If you want to know full features, check the Further Reading section.

## Installation

Since `out_elasticsearch` has been included in the standard distribution of td-agent since v3.0.1, td-agent users do not need to install it manually.

If you have installed Fluentd without td-agent, please install this plugin using `fluent-gem`.

    :::term
    $ fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-elasticsearch

## Example Configuration

The following is a simple working configuration. This should serve as a good starting point for most users.

    :::text
    <match my.logs>
      @type elasticsearch
      host localhost
      port 9200
      logstash_format true
    </match>

For more details on each option, read [the section on Parameters](#parameters).

* [compat_parameters](api-plugin-helper-compat_parameters)

## Parameters

### @type (required)

This option must be always `elasticsearch`.

### host (optional)

The hostname of your Elasticsearch node (default: `localhost`).

### port (optional)

The port number of your Elasticsearch node (default: `9200`).

### hosts (optional)

If you want to connect to more than one Elasticsearch nodes, specify this option in the following format:

    :::text
    hosts host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3
    # or
    hosts https://customhost.com:443/path,https://username:password@host-failover.com:443

If you use this option, the `host` and `port` options are ignored.

### user, password (optional)

The login credentials to connect to the Elasticsearch node (default: `nil`)

    :::text
    user fluent
    password mysecret

### scheme (optional)

Specify `https` if your Elasticsearch endpoint supports SSL (default: `http`)

### path (optional)

The REST API endpoint of Elasticsearch to post write requests (default: `nil`)

### index_name (optional)

The index name to write events to (default: `fluentd`).

This option supports the placeholder syntax of Fluentd plugin API. For example, if you want to partition the index by tags, you can specify as below:

    :::text
    index_name fluentd.${tag}

Here is a more practical example which partitions the Elasticsearch index by tags and timestamps:

    :::text
    index_name fluentd.${tag}.%Y%m%d

### logstash_format (optional)

With this option set `true`, Fluentd uses the conventional index name format `logstash-%Y.%m.%d` (default: `false`). This option supersedes the `index_name` option.

INCLUDE: _log_level_params

## Miscellaneous

You can use `%{}` style placeholders to escape for URL encoding needed characters.

    :::text
    user %{demo+}
    password %{@secret}

are valid configuration.

    :::text
    hosts https://%{j+hn}:%{passw@rd}@host1:443/elastic/,http://host2

are also valid configuration.

But,

    :::text
    user demo+
    password @secret

are invalid configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot send events to Elasticsearch

A common cause of failure is that you are trying to connect to an Elasticsearch instance with an incompatible version.

For example, td-agent currently bundles the 6.x series of the [elasticsearch-ruby](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby) library. This means that your Elasticsearch server also needs to be 6.x. You can check the actual version of the client library installed on your system by executing the following command.

    :::term
    # For td-agent users
    $ /usr/sbin/td-agent-gem list elasticsearch
    # For standalone Fluentd users
    $ fluent-gem list elasticsearch

Or, fluent-plugin-elasticsearch v2.11.8 or later, users can inspect version incompatibility with the `validate_client_version` option:

    :::text
    validate_client_version true

If you get the following error message, please consider to install compatibile elasticsearch client gems:

    :::text
    Detected ES 5 but you use ES client 6.1.0.
    Please consider to use 5.x series ES client.

For further details of the version compatibility issue, please read [the official manual](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby#compatibility).
