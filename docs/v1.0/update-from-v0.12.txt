# Updating Fluentd for v1 from v0.12

This guide is for users to show how to update Fluentd to v1.0 from v0.12 or earlier. For plugin developer, see [Updating plugin for v1.0 from v0.12](plugin-update-from-v0.12).

There are something to be considered:

* Plugins which uses v0.12 API is supported in v1
* Configuration which uses v0.12 style is supported in v1

## Update Fluentd

Fluentd v1 updates dependent ruby and gem versions. For example, Fluentd v1 requires ruby 2.1 or later so you need to check your ruby version first.

To install v1, type `gem install` command. Now v1 will be installed:

    $ gem install fluentd

## Configuration style

Configuration style is same but Fluentd v1 adds several sections for core features. For example, v1 uses `<buffer>` section for output's buffer parameters.

    # v1
    <match pattern>
      @type foo
      database db1
      apikey foobarbaz
      # buffer parameters
      <buffer>
        @type file
        path /path/to/buffer
        flush_interval 10s
      </buffer>
    </match>
    
    # v0.12
    <match pattern>
      @type foo
      database db1
      apikey foobarbaz
      # buffer parameters
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /path/to/buffer
      flush_interval 10s
    </match>

This separates configuration parameters into fluentd core features and plugin-specific features. See "Configuration" panel in the left menu for each section details.

Note that Fluentd v1 automatically converts v0.12 style into v1.0 style during startup phase, so you can reuse v0.12 configuration with v1. See [compat_parameters article](api-plugin-helper-compat_parameters) for correspondence table between v1 and v0.12 parameters.<br />
Of course, v1 configuration is better for using full v1 API features.

## Plugin version

Some popular plugins have already used new v1 plugin API. v1 API based plugins support useful features like flexible chunk keys, placeholders and etc. So we recommend to use latest plugin for Fluentd v1.

Fluentd v1 supports old v0.12 plugin API so you can use older plugins with v1 without code update.

## Treasure Agent(td-agent)

td-agent 3 includes Fluentd v1 serise. If you want to use fluentd v1 with td-agent package, use td-agent 3 instead of td-agent 2.

You can upgrade td-agent 2 to 3 by executing install script for td-agent 3 when you use deb/rpm package.

For more details about install script see following articles:

* [Installing Fluentd using RPM Package (Redhat Linux)](install-by-rpm)
* [Installing Fluentd using DEB Package (Debian / Ubuntu Linux)](install-by-deb)

And then you must reinstall gem packages that you've ever used with td-agent 2.

You should update your td-agent.conf to use Fluentd v1 configuration as soon as possible.
For more details see [Configuration style](#configuration-style).

## Operation

### Log forward from v1.0 to v0.12

Log forwarding from v0.12 to v1.0 is no problem but
Log forwarding from v1.0 to v0.12 has a problem due to timestamp change. See [in_forward's FAQ](/v0.12/articles/in_forward#i-got-messagepack::unknownexttypeerror-error.-why?)
