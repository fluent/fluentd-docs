# Centralize Logs from PHP Applications

The '[fluent-logger-php](http://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-php)' library is used to post records from PHP applications to Fluentd.

This article explains how to use the fluent-logger-php library.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of PHP
  * Basic knowledge of Fluentd
  * PHP 5.3 or higher

## Installing Fluentd

Please refer to the following documents to install fluentd.

* [Install Fluentd with rpm Package](install-by-rpm)
* [Install Fluentd with deb Package](install-by-deb)
* [Install Fluentd with Ruby Gem](install-by-gem)
* [Install Fluentd from source](install-from-source)

## Modifying the Config File

Next, please configure Fluentd to use the [forward Input plugin](in_forward) as its data source.

    :::text
    <source>
      @type forward
      port 24224
    </source>
    <match fluentd.test.**>
      @type stdout
    </match>

Please restart your agent once these lines are in place.

    :::term
    # for rpm/deb only
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    # or systemd
    $ sudo systemctl restart td-agent.service

## Using fluent-logger-php

First, add the 'fluent/logger' package to your composer.json.

    :::json
    {
        "require": {
            "fluent/logger": "1.0.*"
        }
    }

Next, create a php file containing the following code:

    :::php
    <?php
    require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
    use Fluent\Logger\FluentLogger;
    $logger = new FluentLogger("localhost","24224");
    $logger->post("fluentd.test.follow", array("from"=>"userA", "to"=>"userB"));

Executing the script will send the logs to Fluentd.

    :::term
    $ php test.php

The logs should be output to `/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log` or stdout of the Fluentd process via the [stdout Output plugin](out_stdout).
