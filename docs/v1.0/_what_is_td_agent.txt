## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive parts written in C. However, some users may have difficulty installing and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is providing **the stable distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found <a href="//www.fluentd.org/faqs">here</a>.

NOTE: This installation guide is for td-agent v3, the new stable version. td-agent v3 uses fluentd v1.0 in the core. See <a href="td-agent-v2-vs-v3">this page</a> for the comparison between v2 and v3.
