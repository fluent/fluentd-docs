# Troubleshooting Fluentd

## Look at Logs

If things aren't happening as expected, please first look at your logs. For td-agent (rpm/deb), the logs are located at `/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`.

## Turn on Verbose Logging

You can get more information about the logs if verbose logging is turned on. Please follow the steps below.

### Use <system> directive in configuration file

Set `log_level trace`. See also [logging article](logging#by-config-file).

### td-agent systemd with user's unit file

Put your unit file into `/etc/systemd/system/td-agent`. This overwrites existing behaviour of `/usr/lib/systemd/system/td-agent`.

    :::text
    [Service]
    ExecStart=...existing options... -vv

### td-agent init.d with environment variable

1. edit `/etc/init.d/td-agent`
2. add `-vv` to TD_AGENT_OPTIONS
3. restart td-agent

       :::text
       # at /etc/init.d/td-agent
       ...
       TD_AGENT_OPTIONS="... -vv"
       ...

NOTE: This approach doesn't work on systemd environment because systemd hooks init.d's start routine and ignore options.

### gem

Please add `-vv` to your command line.

    :::text
    $ fluentd .. -vv

## Dump fluentd internal information

Fluentd uses [sigdump](https://github.com/frsyuki/sigdump) for dumping fluentd internal information to local file, e.g. thread dump, object allocation and etc.
If you have a problem with fluentd like process hang, please send `SIGCONT` to fluentd parent and child processes.

## High CPU usage issue

If fluentd suddenly hits unexpected high CPU usage problem, there are several reasons:

- a plugin has a race condition or similar bug
- dependent gems have a bug
- regular expression with broken data
- system calls has a bug, e.g. `inotify` with lots of files

In such cases, you can use `perf` tool on recent Linux to investigate the problem. See [Linux perf Examples](http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html) page.<br />
If you want to know which call causes the problem, [pid2line.rb](https://gist.github.com/nurse/0619b6af90df140508c2) is useful.

## Check uncaught logs

You sometimes hit unexpected shutdown with non-zero exit status like below.

    :::text
    2016-01-01 00:00:00 +0800 [info]: starting fluentd-0.12.28
    2016-01-01 00:00:00 +0800 [info]: reading config file path="/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf"
    [...snip...]
    2016-01-01 00:00:02 +0800 [info]: process finished code=6

If the problem happens inside ruby, e.g. segmentation fault, C extension bug, etc,
you can't get entire log when fluentd process is daemonized.
For example, td-agent launches fluentd with `--daemon` option. In td-agent case,
you can get entire log using following command to simulate `/etc/init.d/td-agent start` without daemonize.

    :::text
    $ sudo LD_PRELOAD=/opt/td-agent/embedded/lib/libjemalloc.so /usr/sbin/td-agent -c /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf --user td-agent --group td-agent
