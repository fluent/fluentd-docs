# HTTP RPC

HTTP RPC enables you to manage your Fluentd instance through HTTP endpoints. You can use this feature as a replacement of [Unix signals](signals).

It's especially useful for environments where signals are not supported well (e.g. Windows).

## Configuration

HTTP RPC is not enabled by default. To use this feature, set the `rpc_endpoint` option as follows.

    <system>
      rpc_endpoint 127.0.0.1:24444
    </system>

Now you can manage your Fluentd instance using a HTTP client:

    :::term
    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:24444/api/plugins.flushBuffers
    {"ok":true}

As shown in the above example, each endpoint returns a JSON object as its response.

## HTTP endpoints

### /api/processes.interruptWorkers

Replacement of signal's [SIGINT](signals#sigint-or-sigterm). Stop the daemon.

### /api/processes.killWorkers

Replacement of signal's [SIGTERM](signals#sigint-or-sigterm). Stop the daemon.

### /api/processes.flushBuffersAndKillWorkers

This is essentially a combination of [SIGUSR1](signals#sigusr1) and [SIGTERM](signals#sigint-or-sigterm). Flush the buffer then stop the daemon.

### /api/plugins.flushBuffers

Replacement of signal's [SIGUSR1](signals#sigusr1). Flush the buffered messages.

### /api/config.reload

Replacement of signal's [SIGHUP](signals#sighup). Reload configuration.
