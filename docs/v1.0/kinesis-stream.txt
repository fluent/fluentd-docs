# Collect Log Files into Kinesis Stream in Real-Time

This article explains how to use [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/)'s [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) Output plugin ([out_kinesis](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-fluent-plugin-kinesis)) to aggregate semi-structured logs in real-time. Kinesis plugin is developed and published by Amazon Web Services officially.

## Background

[Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/) is an advanced open-source log collector originally developed at [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/). Because Fluentd can collect logs from various sources, [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) is one of the popular destinations for the output.

Amazon Kinesis is a platform for streaming data on AWS, offering powerful services to make it easy to load and analyze streaming data, and also providing the ability for you to build custom streaming data applications for specialized needs.

This article will show you how to use [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/) to import Apache logs into Amazon Kinesis.

## Mechanism

In this example, Fluentd does 3 things:

1. It continuously “tails” the access log file.
2. It parses the incoming log entries into meaningful fields (such as `ip`, `path`, etc.) and buffers them.
3. It writes the buffered data to Amazon Kinesis periodically.

## Install

For simplicity, this article will describe how to set up an one-node configuration. Please install the following software on the same node.

* [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/)
* Apache (with the Combined Log Format)

You can install Fluentd via major packaging systems.

* [Debian Package](install-by-deb)
* [RPM Package](install-by-rpm)
* [Ruby gem](install-by-gem)

## Install Kinesis Plugin

Since Amazon Kinesis plugin is not bundled with td-agent package, plase install it manually.

    :::terminal
    $ sudo /usr/sbin/td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-kinesis

## Configuration

Let’s start configuring Fluentd. If you used the deb/rpm package, Fluentd's config file is located at /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf. Otherwise, it is located at /etc/fluentd/fluentd.conf.

### Tail Input

For the input source, we will set up Fluentd to track the recent Apache logs (typically found at /var/log/apache2/access_log) The Fluentd configuration file should look like this:

    :::text
    <source>
      @type tail
      path /var/log/apache2/access_log
      pos_file /var/log/td-agent/apache2.access_log.pos
      <parse>
        @type apache2
      </parse>
      tag kinesis.apache.access
    </source>

NOTE: Please make sure that your Apache outputs are in the default 'combined' format. `format apache2` cannot parse custom log formats. Please see the <a href="in_tail">in_tail</a> article for more information.

Let’s go through the configuration line by line.

1. `@type tail`: The tail Input plugin continuously tracks the log file. This handy plugin is included in Fluentd’s core.
2. `@type apache2` in `<parse>`: Uses Fluentd’s built-in Apache log parser.
3. `path /var/log/apache2/access_log`: The location of the Apache log. This may be different for your particular system.
4. `tag kinesis.apache.access`: `kinesis.apache.access` is used as the tag to route the messages within Fluentd.

That’s it! You should now be able to output a JSON-formatted data stream for Fluentd to process.

### Amazon Kinesis Output

The output destination will be Amazon Kinesis. The output configuration should look like this:

    :::text
    <match **>
      # plugin type
      @type kinesis_streams

      # your kinesis stream name
      stream_name <KINESIS_STREAM_NAME>

      # AWS credentials
      aws_key_id <AWS_KEY_ID>
      aws_sec_key <AWS_SECRET_KEY>

      # AWS region
      region us-east-1

      # Use random value for the partition key
      random_partition_key true

      <buffer>
        # Frequency of ingestion
        flush_interval 5s
        # Parallelism of ingestion
        flush_thread_count
      </buffer>
    </match>

The match section specifies the regexp used to look for matching tags. If a matching tag is found in a log, then the config inside `<match>...</match>` is used (i.e. the log is routed according to the config inside). In this example, the `kinesis.apache.access` tag (generated by `tail`) is always used.

The `**` in `match.**` matches zero or more period-delimited tag parts (e.g. match/match.a/match.a.b).

`flush_interval` specifies how often the data is written to Kinesis.

`random_partition_key true` option will generate the partition key via UUID v3 ([source](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-fluent-plugin-kinesis/blob/master/lib/fluent/plugin/out_kinesis.rb#L210)). Kinesis Stream consists of `shards`, and the processing power of each shard is limited. This partition key will be used by Kinesis, to determine which shard wll be assigned to for the specific record.

NOTE: For additional configuration parameters, please see the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-fluent-plugin-kinesis">Kinesis Output plugin</a> README.

NOTE: For those who are interested in security, all communication between Fluentd and Amazon Kinesis are done via HTTPS. If you don't want to have AES keys in the configuration file, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/controlling-access.html">IAM Role based authentication</a> is available too for EC2 nodes.

## Test

Please restart td-agent process first, to make the configuration change available.

    :::term
    # init
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    # systemd
    $ sudo systemctl restart td-agent.service

To test the configuration, just have a couple of accesses to your Apache server. This example uses the `ab` (Apache Bench) program.

    :::term
    $ ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost/

## FAQs

#### Why we need Fluentd, while Kinesis also offers client libraries?

A lot of people use Fluentd + Kinesis, simply because they want to have more choice for [inputs](http://www.fluentd.org/datasources) and [outputs](http://www.fluentd.org/dataoutputs). For inputs, Fluentd has a lot more community contributed plugins and libraries. For outputs, you can send not only Kinesis, but multiple destinations like Amazon S3, local file storage, etc.

## Conclusion

Fluentd + Amazon Kinesis makes real-time log collection simple, easy, and robust.
