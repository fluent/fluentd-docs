# Centralize Logs from Perl Applications

The '[Fluent::Logger](http://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-perl)' library is used to post records from Perl applications to Fluentd.

This article explains how to use the Fluent::Logger library.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Perl
  * Basic knowledge of Fluentd
  * Perl 5.10 or higher

## Installing Fluentd

Please refer to the following documents to install fluentd.

* [Install Fluentd with rpm Package](install-by-rpm)
* [Install Fluentd with deb Package](install-by-deb)
* [Install Fluentd with Ruby Gem](install-by-gem)
* [Install Fluentd from source](install-from-source)

## Modifying the Config File

Next, please configure Fluentd to use the [forward Input plugin](in_forward) as its data source.

    :::text
    <source>
      @type forward
      port 24224
    </source>
    <match fluentd.test.**>
      @type stdout
    </match>

Please restart your agent once these lines are in place.

    :::term
    # for rpm/deb only
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    # or systemd
    $ sudo systemctl restart td-agent.service

## Using Fluent::Logger

First, install the *[Fluent::Logger](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Fluent-Logger/)* library via CPAN.

    :::term
    $ cpan
    cpan[1]> install Fluent::Logger

Next, initialize and post the records as shown below.

    :::perl
    # test.pl
    use Fluent::Logger;
    my $logger = Fluent::Logger->new(
        host => '127.0.0.1',
        port => 24224,
        tag_prefix => 'fluentd.test',
    );
    $logger->post("follow", { "entry1" => "value1", "entry2" => 2 });

Executing the script will send the logs to Fluentd.

    :::term
    $ perl test.pl

The logs should be output to `/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log` or stdout of the Fluentd process via the [stdout Output plugin](out_stdout).
