# Installing Fluentd Using rpm Package

This article explains how to install the [td-agent](https://docs.treasuredata.com/articles/td-agent) rpm package, the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/).

INCLUDE: _what_is_td_agent

## Step 0: Before Installation

Please follow the [Preinstallation Guide](before-install) to configure your OS properly. This will prevent many unnecessary problems.

## Step 1: Install from rpm Repository

It's HIGHLY recommended that you set up <b>ntpd</b> on the node to prevent invalid timestamps in your logs. Please check the [Preinstallation Guide](before-install).

### Redhat / CentOS

CentOS and RHEL 6, 7 64bit are currently supported.

Executing [install-redhat-td-agent3.sh](https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent3.sh) will automatically install td-agent on your machine. This shell script registers a new rpm repository at `/etc/yum.repos.d/td.repo` and installs the `td-agent` rpm package.

    $ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent3.sh | sh

NOTE: We use $releasever for repository path in the script and $releasever should be only major version like "7". If your environment uses other format like "7.2", change it to only major version or setup TD repository manually.

### Amazon Linux

Mainly for Amazon Linux 2. Recent two 64bit versions are supported for amazon linux 1. This means if latest version is `2018.03`, rpm is provided for `2018.03` and `2017.09`.

    # Amazon Linux 2
    $ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-amazon2-td-agent3.sh | sh
    # Amazon Linux 1
    $ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-amazon1-td-agent3.sh | sh

NOTE: Newer td-agent 3 no longer support Amazon Linux 1. If you want to use latest td-agent 3, please upgrade your Amazon Linux 1 to Amazon Linux 2.

NOTE: We use $releasever for repository path in the script and $releasever should be "year.month" format like "2017.09". On AWS, some services modify $releasever to own format and it will cause installation failure. If your environment's $releasever is non-"year.month" format, change it to "year.month" format or setup TD repository manually.

## Step 2: Launch Daemon

td-agent provides 2 scripts:

### systemd

The `/usr/lib/systemd/system/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

    $ sudo systemctl start td-agent.service
    $ sudo systemctl status td-agent.service

If you want to customize systemd behaviour, put your `td-agent.service` into `/etc/systemd/system`

### init.d

The `/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent start
    Starting td-agent: [  OK  ]
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent status
    td-agent (pid  21678) is running...

The following commands are supported:

    :::term
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent start
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent status

Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.

## Step 3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and route them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`). You can post sample log records using the curl command.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
