# Output Plugin Overview

Fluentd has 7 types of plugins: [Input](input-plugin-overview), [Parser](parser-plugin-overview), [Filter](filter-plugin-overview), [Output](output-plugin-overview), [Formatter](formatter-plugin-overview), [Storage](storage-plugin-overview) and [Buffer](buffer-plugin-overview). This article gives an overview of Output Plugin.

## Overview

Fluentd v0.14 output plugins have 3 modes about buffering and flushing.

* *Non-Buffered* mode doesn't buffer data and write out results immediately.
* *Synchronous Buffered* mode has "staged" buffer chunks (a chunk is a collection of events) and a queue of chunks, and its behavior can be controlled by `<buffer>` section (See the diagram below).
* *Asynchronous Buffered* mode also has "stage" and "queue", but output plugin will not commit writing chunks in methods synchronously, but commit later.

![Fluentd v0.14 Plugin API Overview](//docs.fluentd.org/images/fluentd-v0.14-plugin-api-overview.png)

Output plugins can support all modes, but may support just one of these modes. Fluentd choose appropriate mode automatically if there are no `<buffer>` sections in configuration. If users specify `<buffer>` section for output plugins which doesn't support buffering, Fluentd will stop with configuration errors.

Output plugins in v0.14 can control keys of buffer chunking by configurations, dynamically. Users can configure buffer chunk keys as time (any unit specified by user), tag and any key name of records. Output plugin will split events into chunks: events in a chunk have same values for chunk keys.
The output plugin's buffer behavior (if any) is defined by a separate [Buffer plugin](buffer-plugin-overview). Different buffer plugins can be chosen for each output plugin.

## Difference between v0.14 and v0.12

Fluentd v0.12 uses only `<match>` section for both of configuration parameters of output plugin and buffer plugin.
Fluentd v0.14 uses `<buffer>` subsection to write parameters for buffering, flushing and retrying. `<match>` sections are used only for output plugin itself.

Example of v0.14 output plugin configuration:

    :::text
    <match myservice_name>
      @type file
      path /my/data/access.${tag}.%Y-%m-%d.%H%M.log
      <buffer tag,time>
        @type file
        path /my/buffer/myservice
        timekey     60m
        timekey_wait 1m
      </buffer>
    </source>

For Fluentd v0.12, configuration parameters for buffer plugins were written in same section:

    :::text
    <match myservice_name>
      @type file
      path /my/data/access.myservice_name.*.log
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /my/buffer/myservice/access.myservice_name.*.log
      time_slice_format %Y-%m-%d.%H%M
      time_slice_wait   1m
    </source>

## Buffering/Retrying Parameters

See [Buffer section configurations](buffer-section).

### Control Flushing

See [Buffer Plugin Overview](buffer-plugin-overview) for the basic behaviour of buffer.

#### flush_mode

The default is `default`. Supported types are `default`, `lazy`, `interval` or `immediate`

How to enqueue chunks to be flushed. "interval" flushes per flush_interval, "immediate" flushes just after event arrival.

#### flush_interval

the default is 60

The interval between buffer chunk flushes.

#### flush_thread_count

The default is 1.

The number of threads to flush the buffer.

#### flush_thread_interval

The default is `1.0`

Seconds to sleep between checks for buffer flushes in flush threads.

#### flush_thread_burst_interval

The default is `1.0`

Seconds to sleep between flushes when many buffer chunks are queued.

#### delayed_commit_timeout

The default is 60.

Seconds of timeout for buffer chunks to be committed by plugins later

#### overflow_action

Control the buffer behaviour when the queue becomes full. 3 modes are supported:

- throw_exception

This is default mode. This mode raises `BufferQueueLimitError` exception to input plugin. How handle `BufferQueueLimitError` depends on input plugins, e.g. tail input stops reading new lines, forward input returns an error to forward output. This action fits for streaming manner.

- block

This mode stops input plugin thread until buffer full is resolved. This action is good for batch-like use-case.

We don't recommend to use `block` action to avoid `BufferQueueLimitError`. Please consider improving destination setting to resolve `BufferQueueLimitError` or use `@ERROR` label for routing overflowed events to another backup destination(or `secondary` with lower `retry_limit`). If you hit `BufferQueueLimitError` frequently, it means your destination capacity is insufficient for your traffic.

- drop_oldest_chunk

This mode drops oldest chunks. This mode is useful for monitoring system destinations. For monitoring, newer events are important than older.


### Control Retrying

If the bottom chunk write out fails, it will remain in the queue and Fluentd will retry after waiting several seconds (`retry_wait`). If the retry limit has not been disabled (`retry_forever` is true) and the retry count exceeds the specified limit (`retry_max_times`), the chunk is trashed. The retry wait time doubles each time (1.0sec, 2.0sec, 4.0sec, ...) until `retry_max_interval` is reached. If the queue length exceeds the specified limit (`queue_limit_length`), new events are rejected.

NOTE: writing out the bottom chunk is considered to be a failure if "Output#write" or `Output#try_write` method throws an exception.

#### retry_type

The default is `exponential_backoff`.

How to wait next retry to flush buffer. Supported types are `exponential_backoff` or `periodic`

#### retry_forever

The default is false.

If true, plugin will ignore retry_timeout and retry_max_times options and retry flushing forever.

#### retry_timeout

The default is 72 hours.

The maximum seconds to retry to flush while failing, until plugin discards buffer chunks.

#### retry_max_times

The default is `nil`

The maximum number of times to retry to flush while failing. If `retry_timeout` is the default, the number is 17 with exponential backoff.

#### retry_secondary_threshold

The default is `0.8`

The ratio of retry_timeout to switch to use secondary while failing.

#### retry_wait

The default is 1

Seconds to wait before next retry to flush, or constant factor of exponential backoff.

#### retry_exponential_backoff_base

The default is 2

The base number of exponencial backoff for retries.

#### retry_max_interval

The default is `nil`.

The maximum interval seconds for exponential backoff between retries while failing.

#### retry_randomize, :bool, default: true

The default is `true`.

If true, output plugin will retry after randomized interval not to do burst retries.

For other configuration parameters available in `<buffer>` sections, see [Buffer plugin overview](buffer-plugin-overview) and each plugins.

## Secondary Output

In buffered mode, the user can specify `<secondary>` with any output plugin in `<match>` configuration.
If plugins continue to fail writing buffer chunks and exceeds the timeout threshold for retries, then output plugins will delegate to write the buffer chunk to secondary plugin.

`<secondary>` is useful for backup when destination servers are unavailable, e.g. forward, mongo and other plugins. We strongly recommend `out_secondary_file` plugin for `<secondary>`.
