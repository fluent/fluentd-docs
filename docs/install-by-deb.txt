# Installing Fluentd Using deb Package

This article explains how to install the td-agent deb package, the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/).

NOTE: For Ubuntu, "14.04 LTS / Trusty", "12.04 LTS / Precise", "10.04 LTS / Lucid" are currently supported. For Debian, Squeeze, Wheezy and Jessie are supported. If you are interested in other versions/platforms, please contact us on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/fluentd">mailing list</a>. If enough people express interest, we may consider supporting it.

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive parts written in C. However, some users may have difficulty installing and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is providing **the stable distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found <a href="//www.fluentd.org/faqs">here</a>.

NOTE: This installation guide is for td-agent v2, the current stable version. See <a href="td-agent-v1-vs-v2">this page</a> for the comparison between v1 and v2. <a href="install-by-deb-v1">Here</a> is the deb installation guide for v1.

## Step 0: Before Installation

Please follow the [Preinstallation Guide](before-install) to configure your OS properly. This will prevent many unnecessary problems.

## Step 1 : Install from Apt Repository

For Ubuntu, "Ubuntu 14.04 LTS / Trusty", "Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Precise" and "Ubuntu 10.04 LTS / Lucid" are currently supported.

For Debian, Wheezy and Squeeze are currently supported.

A shell script is provided to automate the installation process for each version. The shell script registers a new apt repository at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/treasure-data.list` and installs the `td-agent` deb package.

For Trusty,

    :::term
    curl -L https://td-toolbelt.herokuapp.com/sh/install-ubuntu-trusty-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Precise,

    :::term
    curl -L https://td-toolbelt.herokuapp.com/sh/install-ubuntu-precise-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Lucid,

    :::term
    curl -L https://td-toolbelt.herokuapp.com/sh/install-ubuntu-lucid-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Debian Jessie,

    :::term
    curl -L https://td-toolbelt.herokuapp.com/sh/install-debian-jessie-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Debian Wheezy,

    :::term
    curl -L https://td-toolbelt.herokuapp.com/sh/install-debian-wheezy-td-agent2.sh | sh

For Debian Squeeze,

    :::term
    curl -L https://td-toolbelt.herokuapp.com/sh/install-debian-squeeze-td-agent2.sh | sh

NOTE: It's HIGHLY recommended that you set up <b>ntpd</b> on the node to prevent invalid timestamps in your logs.

## Step2: Launch Daemon

The `/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent status
    td-agent (pid  21678) is running...

The following commands are supported:

    :::term
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent start
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent status

Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.

## Step3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and route them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`). You can post sample log records using the curl command.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
