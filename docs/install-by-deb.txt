# Installing Fluentd Using deb Package

This article explains how to install the td-agent deb package, the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/).

NOTE: "Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Precise" and "Ubuntu 10.04 LTS / Lucid" are currently supported. If you are interested in Debian, please contact us on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/fluentd">mailing list</a>. If enough people express interest, we may consider supporting it.

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive parts written in C. However, casual users may have difficulty installing and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is providing **the stable distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found [here](faq#what-is-the-difference-with-td-agent-and-fluentd).

## Step0: Before Installation

Please follow the [Preinstallation Guide](before-install) to configure your OS properly. This will prevent many unnecessary problems.

### GPG key

The deb package is signed with the Treasure Data GPG key, which can be found [here](http://packages.treasure-data.com/). We recommend importing the GPG key to apt.

    $ apt-key add /path/to/RPM-GPG-KEY-td-agent

## Step1 (Ubuntu): Install from Apt Repository

"Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Precise" and "Ubuntu 10.04 LTS / Lucid" are currently supported.

#### Ubuntu Precise
Executing [install-ubuntu-precise.sh](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-precise.sh) will automatically install td-agent on your machine. This shell script registers a new apt repository at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/treasure-data.list` and installs the `td-agent` deb package.

    :::term
    $ curl -L http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-precise.sh | sh

#### Ubuntu Lucid
Executing [install-ubuntu-lucid.sh](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-lucid.sh) will automatically install td-agent on your machine. This shell script registers a new apt repository at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/treasure-data.list` and installs the `td-agent` deb package.

    :::term
    $ curl -L http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-lucid.sh | sh

NOTE: It's HIGHLY recommended that you set up <b>ntpd</b> on the node to prevent invalid timestamps in your logs.

## Step2: Launch Daemon

The `/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent status
    td-agent (pid  21678) is running...

The following commands are supported:

    :::term
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent start
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent status

Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.

## Step3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and route them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`). You can post sample log records using the curl command.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
