# Fluentd deb Installation

This article describes how to install td-agent deb package, the stable distribution package of fluentd maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasure-data.com/).

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for the flexibility, but the installation and the operation of Ruby daemon have some difficulties for the casual users. That's why Treasure Data, Inc. is providing the stable distribution of Fluentd. The detailed difference between fluentd and td-agent can be found [here](http://community.fluentd.org/a/what-is-the-difference-with-td-agent-and-fluentd/).

## Step1: Add the Apt Repository

Currently, only "Ubuntu 10.04 LTS / Lucid" and "Debian Lenny" are supported.

#### Ubuntu Lucid

Please add the Treasure Data apt repository to your sources list. This command will set it up for you:

    :::term
    $ sudo apt-add-repository 'deb http://packages.treasure-data.com/debian/ lucid contrib'

#### Debian Lenny

Please add this line to your `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

    :::term
    deb http://packages.treasure-data.com/lenny/ lenny contrib

## Step2: Install and Launch

Then, please update your apt repositories and install td-agent package:

    :::term
    $ apt-get update
    $ apt-get install td-agent

To upgrade the existing agent, run the following command:

    :::term
    $ apt-get update && apt-get install td-agent

`/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is also provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

    :::term
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent start
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent restart

Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.

## Step3: Put Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and routes them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`). You can post the sample log records by curl command.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
